From a global fit to the first thrust moment we extract the strong coupling and the leading power correction matrix element Omega\_1. We obtain alpha\_s(m\_Z) = 0.1141 {\textbackslash}pm (0.0004)\_exp {\textbackslash}pm (0.0014)\_hadr {\textbackslash}pm (0.0007)\_pert, where the 1-sigma uncertainties are experimental, from hadronization (related to Omega\_1) and perturbative, respectively, and Omega\_1 = 0.372 {\textbackslash}pm (0.044)\_exp {\textbackslash}pm (0.039)\_pert GeV. The n-th thrust cumulants for n {$>$} 1 are completely insensitive to Omega\_1, and therefore a good instrument for extracting information on higher order power corrections, Omega'\_n/Q{\textasciicircum}n, from moment data.

  abstract = {This book provides a multi-level introduction to Bayesian reasoning (as opposed to "conventional statistics") and its applications to data analysis. The basic ideas of this "new" approach to the quantification of uncertainty are presented using examples from research and everyday life. Applications covered include: parametric inference; combination of results; treatment of uncertainty due to systematic errors and background; comparison of hypotheses; unfolding of experimental distributions; upper/lower bounds in frontier-type measurements. Approximate methods for routine use are derived and are shown often to coincide -- under well-defined assumptions! -- with "standard" methods, which can therefore be seen as special cases of the more general Bayesian methods. In dealing with uncertainty in measurements, modern metrological ideas are utilized, including the ISO classification of uncertainty into type A and type B. These are shown to fit well into the Bayesian framework.},

In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used in high-energy experimental physics to unfold detector effects from multi-particle final states, while preserving correlations between kinematic variables in multidimensional phase space. We perform a full closure test on two-pion photoproduction pseudodata generated with a realistic model in the kinematics of the Jefferson Lab CLAS g11 experiment. The overlap of different reaction mechanisms leading to the same final state associated with the CLAS detector's nontrivial effects represents an ideal test case for AI-supported analysis. Uncertainty quantification performed via bootstrap provides an estimate of the systematic uncertainty associated with the procedure. The test demonstrates that GANs can reproduce highly correlated multidifferential cross sections even in the presence of detector-induced distortions in the training datasets, and provides a solid basis for applying the framework to real experimental data.},

While traditional methods are limited to representing the data in a low number of dimensions, machine learning has enabled new unfolding techniques while retaining the full dimensionality. Generative networks like invertible neural networks{\textasciitilde}(INN) enable a probabilistic unfolding, which map individual events to their corresponding unfolded probability distribution. The accuracy of such methods is however limited by how well simulated training samples model the actual data that is unfolded. We introduce the iterative conditional INN{\textasciitilde}(IcINN) for unfolding that adjusts for deviations between simulated training samples and data. The IcINN unfolding is first validated on toy data and then applied to pseudo-data for the \$pp {\textbackslash}to Z {\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}gamma\$ process.},

Information on the detector resolution is usually given by a set of Monte Carlo events. Based on the experience with a widely used unfolding program (RUN) a modified method has been developed. The first step of the method is a maximum likelihood fit of the Monte Carlo distributions to the measured distribution in one, two or three dimensions; the finite statistic of the Monte Carlo events is taken into account by the use of Barlows method with a new method of solution. A clustering method is used before to combine bins in sparsely populated areas. In the second step a regularization is applied to the solution, which introduces only a small bias. The regularization parameter is determined from the data after a diagonalization and rotation procedure.},

  abstract = {Scientific machine learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems and PDE discovery in computational physics. One caveat concerning current methods is the need for large amounts of ("clean") data, in order to characterize the full system response and discover underlying physical models. Bayesian methods may be particularly promising for overcoming these challenges, as they are naturally less sensitive to the negative effects of sparse and noisy data. In this paper, we propose to use Bayesian neural networks (BNN) in order to: 1) Recover the full system states from measurement data (e.g. temperature, velocity field, etc.). We use Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo to sample the posterior distribution of a deep and dense BNN, and show that it is possible to accurately capture physics of varying complexity, without overfitting. 2) Recover the parameters instantiating the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) governing the physical system. Using the trained BNN, as a surrogate of the system response, we generate datasets of derivatives that are potentially comprising the latent PDE governing the observed system and then perform a sequential threshold Bayesian linear regression (STBLR), between the successive derivatives in space and time, to recover the original PDE parameters. We take advantage of the confidence intervals within the BNN outputs, and introduce the spatial derivatives cumulative variance into the STBLR likelihood, to mitigate the influence of highly uncertain derivative data points; thus allowing for more accurate parameter discovery. We demonstrate our approach on a handful of example, in applied physics and non-linear dynamics.},

These common themes in event generator development lead to a more comprehensive understanding of physics at the highest energies and intensities, and allow models to be tested against a wealth of data that have been accumulated over the past decades. A cohesive approach to event generator development will allow these models to be further improved and systematic uncertainties to be reduced, directly contributing to future experimental success.

They typically involve a number of unknown model parameters that must be tuned to experimental data, while maintaining the integrity of the underlying physics models.

  abstract = {We seek to achieve the Holy Grail of Bayesian inference for gravitational-wave astronomy: using deep-learning techniques to instantly produce the posterior \$p({\textbackslash}theta{\textbar}D)\$ for the source parameters \${\textbackslash}theta\$, given the detector data \$D\$. To do so, we train a deep neural network to take as input a signal + noise data set (drawn from the astrophysical source-parameter prior and the sampling distribution of detector noise), and to output a parametrized approximation of the corresponding posterior. We rely on a compact representation of the data based on reduced-order modeling, which we generate efficiently using a separate neural-network waveform interpolant [A. J. K. Chua, C. R. Galley \& M. Vallisneri, Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 211101 (2019)].

  abstract = {Over the next decade, increases in instantaneous luminosity and detector granularity will amplify the amount of data that has to be analysed by high-energy physics experiments, whether in real time or offline, by an order of magnitude. The reconstruction of charged particle tracks, which has always been a crucial element of offline data processing pipelines, must increasingly be deployed from the very first stages of the real time processing to enable experiments to achieve their physics goals. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received a great deal of attention in the community because their computational complexity scales nearly linearly with the number of hits in the detector, unlike conventional algorithms which often scale quadratically or worse. This paper presents ETX4VELO, a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's Vertex Locator, in the context of LHCb's fully GPU-based first-level trigger system, Allen. Currently implemented in Python, ETX4VELO offers the ability to reconstruct tracks with shared hits using a novel triplet-based method. When benchmarked against the traditional track-finding algorithm in Allen, this GNN-based approach not only matches but occasionally surpasses its physics performance. In particular, the fraction of fake tracks is reduced from over 2\% to below 1\% and the efficiency to reconstruct electrons is improved. While achieving comparable physics performance is a milestone, the immediate priority remains implementing ETX4VELO in Allen in order to determine and optimise its throughput, to meet the demands of this high-rate environment.},

To address the anticipated surge in luminosity and consequent event rate, the LHCb experiment is transitioning to a fully software-based trigger system. This evolution necessitated innovations in hardware configurations, software paradigms, and algorithmic design. A significant advancement is the integration of monotonic Lipschitz neural networks into the LHCb trigger system. These deep learning models offer certified robustness against detector instabilities, and the ability to encode domain-specific inductive biases. Such properties are crucial for the inclusive heavy-flavour triggers and, most notably, for the topological triggers designed to inclusively select \$b\$-hadron candidates by exploiting the unique kinematic and decay topologies of beauty decays. This paper describes the recent progress in integrating Lipschitz neural networks into the topological triggers, highlighting the resulting enhanced sensitivity to highly displaced multi-body candidates produced within the LHCb acceptance.},

A phenomenological analysis based on power correction models including hadron mass effects for both differential distributions and mean values is presented. Using power corrections, alpha\_s is extracted from the mean values and shapes. In an alternative approach, renormalisation group invariance (RGI) is used as an explicit constraint, leading to a consistent description of mean values without the need for sizeable power corrections. The QCD beta-function is precisely measured using this approach. From the DELPHI data on Thrust, including data from low energy experiments, one finds beta\_0 = 7.86 +/- 0.32 for the one loop coefficient of the beta-function or, assuming QCD, n\_f = 4.75 +/- 0.44 for the number of active flavours. These values agree well with the QCD expectation of beta\_0=7.67 and n\_f=5. A direct measurement of the full logarithmic energy slope excludes light gluinos with a mass below 5 GeV.},

Two main approaches have emerged in this research area: one based on discriminative models and one based on generative models. The main advantage of discriminative models is that they learn a small correction to a starting simulation while generative models scale better to regions of phase space with little data. We propose to use Schroedinger Bridges and diffusion models to create SBUnfold, an unfolding approach that combines the strengths of both discriminative and generative models. The key feature of SBUnfold is that its generative model maps one set of events into another without having to go through a known probability density as is the case for normalizing flows and standard diffusion models. We show that SBUnfold achieves excellent performance compared to state of the art methods on a synthetic Z+jets dataset.},

  abstract = {This article describes a robust algorithm to estimate a conditional probability density f(t{\textbar}x) as a non-parametric smooth regression function. It is based on a neural network and the Bayesian interpretation of the network output as a posteriori probabability. The network is trained using example events from history or simulation, which define the underlying probability density f(t,x). Once trained, the network is applied on new, unknown examples x, for which it can predict the probability distribution of the target variable t. Event-by-event knowledge of the smooth function f(t{\textbar}x) can be very useful, e.g. in maximum likelihood fits or for forecasting tasks. No assumptions are necessary about the distribution, and non-Gaussian tails are accounted for automatically. Important quantities like median, mean value, left and right standard deviations, moments and expectation values of any function of t are readily derived from it. The algorithm can be considered as an event-by-event unfolding and leads to statistically optimal reconstruction. The largest benefit of the method lies in complicated problems, when the measurements x are only relatively weakly correlated to the output t. As to assure optimal generalisation features and to avoid overfitting, the networks are regularised by extended versions of weight decay. The regularisation parameters are determined during the online-learning of the network by relations obtained from Bayesian statistics. Some toy Monte Carlo tests and first real application examples from high-energy physics and econometry are discussed.},

  abstract = {The LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is designed to perform high-precision measurements of heavy-hadron decays, which requires the collection of large data samples and a good understanding and suppression of multiple background sources. Both factors are challenged by a five-fold increase in the average number of proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing, corresponding to a change in the detector operation conditions for the LHCb Upgrade I phase, recently started. A further ten-fold increase is expected in the Upgrade II phase, planed for the next decade. The limits in the storage capacity of the trigger will bring an inverse relation between the amount of particles selected to be stored per event and the number of events that can be recorded, and the background levels will raise due to the enlarged combinatorics. To tackle both challenges, we propose a novel approach, never attempted before in a hadronic collider: a Deep-learning based Full Event Interpretation (DFEI), to perform the simultaneous identification, isolation and hierarchical reconstruction of all the heavy-hadron decay chains per event. This approach radically contrasts with the standard selection procedure used in LHCb to identify heavy-hadron decays, that looks individually at sub-sets of particles compatible with being products of specific decay types, disregarding the contextual information from the rest of the event. We present the first prototype for the DFEI algorithm, that leverages the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). This paper describes the design and development of the algorithm, and its performance in Upgrade I simulated conditions.},

The shift from traditional methods to machine learning-based approaches has led to significant advancements in simulating complex detector responses. CaloShowerGAN is a new approach for fast calorimeter simulation based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We use Dataset 1 of the Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge 2022 to demonstrate the efficacy of the model to simulate calorimeter showers produced by photons and pions. The dataset is originated from the ATLAS experiment, and we anticipate that this approach can be seamlessly integrated into the ATLAS system. This development brings a significant improvement compared to the deployed GANs by ATLAS and could offer great enhancement to the current ATLAS fast simulations.},

Scott FitzgeraldThe previous chapter demonstrated that filtering is needed when noise is present. This chapter takes a closer look at filtering, which is also referred to as regularization because it can be interpreted as enforcing certain regularity conditions on the solution. The degree of regularization is governed by a regularization parameter that should be chosen carefully. We focus on two candidate regularization methods (TSVD and Tikhonov) and three candidate ways to compute the regularization parameter (the discrepancy principle, generalized cross validation, and the L-curve criterion).6.1 Two Important MethodsThe SVD analysis in the previous chapter motivates the use of spectral filtering methods because these methods give us control---via the filter factors---over the spectral contents of the deblurred images.},

  abstract = {Simulating ultra-high-granularity detector responses in Particle Physics represents a critical yet computationally demanding task. This thesis aims to overcome this challenge for the Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD) at the Belle II experiment, which features over 7.5M pixel channels-the highest spatial resolution detector simulation dataset ever analysed with generative models. This thesis starts off by a comprehensive and taxonomic review on generative models for simulating detector signatures. Then, it presents the Intra-Event Aware Generative Adversarial Network (IEA-GAN), a new geometry-aware generative model that introduces a relational attentive reasoning and Self-Supervised Learning to approximate an "event" in the detector. This study underscores the importance of intra-event correlation for downstream physics analyses. Building upon this, the work drifts towards a more generic approach and presents YonedaVAE, a Category Theory-inspired generative model that tackles the open problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) simulation. YonedaVAE introduces a learnable Yoneda embedding to capture the entirety of an event based on its sensor relationships, formulating a Category theoretical language for intra-event relational reasoning. This is complemented by introducing a Self-Supervised learnable prior for VAEs and an Adaptive Top-q sampling mechanism, enabling the model to sample point clouds with variable intra-category cardinality in a zero-shot manner. Variable Intra-event cardinality has not been approached before and is vital for simulating irregular detector geometries. Trained on an early experiment data, YonedaVAE can reach a reasonable OOD simulation precision of a later experiment with almost double luminosity. This study introduces, for the first time, the results of using deep generative models for ultra-high granularity detector simulation in Particle Physics.},

The repriorisation map acts directly on parameters, and its analytic simplicity complements the known neural network Gaussian process (NNGP) behaviour of wide BNNs in function space. Exploiting the repriorisation, we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior sampling algorithm which mixes faster the wider the BNN. This contrasts with the typically poor performance of MCMC in high dimensions. We observe up to 50x higher effective sample size relative to no reparametrisation for both fully-connected and residual networks. Improvements are achieved at all widths, with the margin between reparametrised and standard BNNs growing with layer width.},

For computational reasons, researchers approximate this posterior using inexpensive mini-batch methods such as mean-field variational inference or stochastic-gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC). To investigate foundational questions in Bayesian deep learning, we instead use full-batch Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) on modern architectures. We show that (1) BNNs can achieve significant performance gains over standard training and deep ensembles; (2) a single long HMC chain can provide a comparable representation of the posterior to multiple shorter chains; (3) in contrast to recent studies, we find posterior tempering is not needed for near-optimal performance, with little evidence for a "cold posterior" effect, which we show is largely an artifact of data augmentation; (4) BMA performance is robust to the choice of prior scale, and relatively similar for diagonal Gaussian, mixture of Gaussian, and logistic priors; (5) Bayesian neural networks show surprisingly poor generalization under domain shift; (6) while cheaper alternatives such as deep ensembles and SGMCMC methods can provide good generalization, they provide distinct predictive distributions from HMC. Notably, deep ensemble predictive distributions are similarly close to HMC as standard SGLD, and closer than standard variational inference.},

On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model -- uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.},

We prove the efficacy of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating scientific data while retaining a high level of accuracy for diverse metrics across a large range of input variables. We demonstrate a successful application of the transfer learning concept: we train the network to simulate showers for electrons from a reduced range of primary energies, we then train further for a five times larger range (the model could not train for the larger range directly). The same concept is extended to generate showers for other particles depositing most of their energies in electromagnetic interactions (photons and neutral pions). In addition, the generation of charged pion showers is also explored, a more accurate effort would require additional data from other detectors not included in the scope of the current work. Our further contribution is a demonstration of using GAN-generated data for a practical application. We train a third-party network using GAN-generated data and prove that the response is similar to a network trained with data from the Monte Carlo simulation. The showers generated by GAN present accuracy within \$\$10{\textbackslash}\%\$\$of Monte Carlo for a diverse range of physics features, with three orders of magnitude speedup. The speedup for both the training and inference can be further enhanced by distributed training.},

  abstract = {Representing the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton and other hadrons through flexible, high-fidelity parametrizations has been a long-standing goal of particle physics phenomenology. This is particularly true since the chosen parametrization methodology can play an influential role in the ultimate PDF uncertainties as extracted in QCD global analyses; these, in turn, are often determinative of the reach of experiments at the LHC and other facilities to non-standard physics, including at large \$x\$, where parametrization effects can be significant. In this study, we explore a series of encoder-decoder machine-learning (ML) models with various neural-network topologies as efficient means of reconstructing PDFs from meaningful information stored in an interpretable latent space. Given recent effort to pioneer synergies between QCD analyses and lattice-gauge calculations, we formulate a latent representation based on the behavior of PDFs in Mellin space, i.e., their integrated moments, and test the ability of various models to decode PDFs from this information faithfully. We introduce a numerical package, \${\textbackslash}texttt\{PDFdecoder\}\$, which implements several encoder-decoder models to reconstruct PDFs with high fidelity and use this tool to explore strengths and pitfalls of neural-network approaches to PDF parametrization. We additionally dissect patterns of learned correlations between encoded Mellin moments and reconstructed PDFs which suggest opportunities for further improvements to ML-based approaches to PDF parametrizations and uncertainty quantification.},

On the other hand, massive potential gains in performance over standard, "experience-driven" layouts are in principle within our reach if an objective function fully aligned with the final goals of the instrument is maximized by means of a systematic search of the configuration space. The stochastic nature of the involved quantum processes make the modeling of these systems an intractable problem from a classical statistics point of view, yet the construction of a fully differentiable pipeline and the use of deep learning techniques may allow the simultaneous optimization of all design parameters. In this document we lay down our plans for the design of a modular and versatile modeling tool for the end-to-end optimization of complex instruments for particle physics experiments as well as industrial and medical applications that share the detection of radiation as their basic ingredient. We consider a selected set of use cases to highlight the specific needs of different applications.},

We consider the problem of quantifying the uncertainty in predictions of GNN stemming from modeling errors and measurement uncertainty. We consider aleatoric uncertainty in the form of probabilistic links and noise in feature vector of nodes, while epistemic uncertainty is incorporated via a probability distribution over the model parameters. We propose a unified approach to treat both sources of uncertainty in a Bayesian framework, where Assumed Density Filtering is used to quantify aleatoric uncertainty and Monte Carlo dropout captures uncertainty in model parameters. Finally, the two sources of uncertainty are aggregated to estimate the total uncertainty in predictions of a GNN. Results in the real-world datasets demonstrate that the Bayesian model performs at par with a frequentist model and provides additional information about predictions uncertainty that are sensitive to uncertainties in the data and model.},

Their main value is the ability to compute gradients of physical processes, which allows differentiable simulators to be readily integrated into commonly employed gradient-based optimization schemes. To achieve this, a number of design decisions need to be considered representing trade-offs in versatility, computational speed, and accuracy of the gradients obtained. This paper presents an in-depth review of the evolving landscape of differentiable physics simulators. We introduce the foundations and core components of differentiable simulators alongside common design choices. This is followed by a practical guide and overview of open-source differentiable simulators that have been used across past research. Finally, we review and contextualize prominent applications of differentiable simulation. By offering a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in differentiable simulation, this work aims to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners looking to understand and integrate differentiable physics within their research.

However, running detailed simulation models requires a tremendous amount of computation resources. New approaches to speed up detector simulation are therefore needed. The generation of calorimeter responses is often the most expensive component of the simulation chain for HEP experiments. It was shown that deep learning techniques, especially Generative Adversarial Networks, may be used to reproduce the calorimeter response. However, those applications are challenging, as the generated responses need evaluation not only in terms of image consistency: different physics-based quality metrics should be also taken into consideration. In our work, we develop a multitask GAN-based framework with the goal to speed up the response generation of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) of the LHCb detector at LHC. We introduce the Auxiliary Regressor as a second task to evaluate a proxy metric of the given input that is used by the Discriminator of the GAN. We show that this approach improves the stability of GAN and the model produces samples with better physics distributions.},

  abstract = {In recent years, interest has grown in alternative strategies for the search for New Physics beyond the Standard Model. One envisaged solution lies in the development of anomaly detection algorithms based on unsupervised machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network-based auto-encoder model that allows both anomaly detection and model-independent background modeling. This algorithm can be integrated with other model-independent tools in a complete heavy resonance search strategy. The proposed strategy has been tested on the LHC Olympics 2020 dataset with promising results.},

  abstract = {During the past five years the Bayesian deep learning community has developed increasingly accurate and efficient approximate inference procedures that allow for Bayesian inference in deep neural networks. However, despite this algorithmic progress and the promise of improved uncertainty quantification and sample efficiency there are---as of early 2020---no publicized deployments of Bayesian neural networks in industrial practice. In this work we cast doubt on the current understanding of Bayes posteriors in popular deep neural networks: we demonstrate through careful MCMC sampling that the posterior predictive induced by the Bayes posterior yields systematically worse predictions compared to simpler methods including point estimates obtained from SGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predictive performance is improved significantly through the use of a "cold posterior" that overcounts evidence. Such cold posteriors sharply deviate from the Bayesian paradigm but are commonly used as heuristic in Bayesian deep learning papers. We put forward several hypotheses that could explain cold posteriors and evaluate the hypotheses through experiments. Our work questions the goal of accurate posterior approximations in Bayesian deep learning: If the true Bayes posterior is poor, what is the use of more accurate approximations? Instead, we argue that it is timely to focus on understanding the origin of the improved performance of cold posteriors.},

  abstract = {A framework is developed to explore the connection between effective optimization algorithms and the problems they are solving. A number of "no free lunch" (NFL) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori "head-to-head" minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms.},

The algorithm is available with ROOT release later than 5.29.},
