The   identification performances of a variety of algorithms are   characterized in simulated events and directly compared with   data. The algorithms are validated using proton-proton collision   data at √s = 13TeV, corresponding to an integrated   luminosity of 35.9 fb−1.  Systematic uncertainties are assessed by   comparing the results obtained using simulation and collision data.   The new techniques studied in this paper provide significant   performance improvements over non-ML techniques, reducing the   background rate by up to an order of magnitude at the same signal   efficiency.}

	abstract = {Measurements of the substructure of top-quark jets are presented, using 140 fb−1 of 13 TeV ��⁢�� collision data recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Top-quark jets reconstructed with the anti-���� algorithm with a radius parameter �� =1.0 are selected in top-quark pair (��⁢¯��) events where one top quark decays semileptonically and the other hadronically, or where both top quarks decay hadronically. The top-quark jets are required to have transverse momentum ��T {\textgreater}350 GeV, yielding large samples of data events with jet ��T values between 350 and 600 GeV. One- and two-dimensional differential cross sections for eight substructure variables, defined using only the charged components of the jets, are measured in a particle-level phase space by correcting for the smearing and acceptance effects induced by the detector. The differential cross sections are compared with the predictions of several Monte Carlo simulations in which top-quark pair-production quantum chromodynamic matrix-element calculations at next-to-leading-order precision in the strong coupling constant ��S are passed to leading-order parton shower and hadronization generators. The Monte Carlo predictions for measures of the broadness, and also the two-body structure, of the top-quark jets are found to be in good agreement with the measurements, while variables sensitive to the three-body structure of the top-quark jets exhibit some tension with the measured distributions.},

	abstract = {A measurement of the differential cross section for the inclusive production of isolated prompt photons in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb−1 recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. The measurement covers the pseudorapidity range {\textbar}��{\textbar} {\textless}2.5 and the transverse energy range 25 {\textless}��T {\textless}400 GeV, corresponding to the kinematic region 0.007 {\textless}��T {\textless}0.114. Photon candidates are identified with two complementary methods, one based on photon conversions in the silicon tracker and the other on isolated energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The measured cross section is presented as a function of ��T in four pseudorapidity regions. The next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations are consistent with the measured cross section.},

    abstract = {Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 inverse femtobarns at 7 TeV and 5.3 inverse femtobarns at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: gamma gamma, ZZ, WW, tau tau, and b b-bar. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, gamma gamma and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3 +/- 0.4 (stat.) +/- 0.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.},

    abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 2,143 new measurements from 709 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Machine Learning, and one on Spectroscopy of Light Meson Resonances.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 97 review articles.

    abstract = {Interest for studying cosmic neutrinos using deep-sea detectors has increased after the discovery of a diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos by the IceCube collaboration and the possibility of wider multi-messenger studies with the observations of gravitational waves. The ANTARES detector was the first neutrino telescope in seawater, operating successfully in the Mediterranean Sea for more than a decade and a half. All challenges related to the operation in the deep sea were accurately addressed by the collaboration. Deployment and connection operations became smoother over time; data taking and constant re-calibration of the detector due to the variable environmental conditions were fully automated. A wealth of results on the subject of astroparticle physics, particle physics and multi-messenger astronomy have been obtained, despite the relative modest size of the detector, paving the way to a new generation of larger undersea detectors. This review summarizes the efforts by the ANTARES collaboration that made the possibility to operate neutrino telescopes in seawater a reality and the results obtained in this endeavor.},

Theoretical predictions are computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. The most widely employed sets of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) are used, and PDF, strong coupling, and missing higher order uncertainties are taken into account. We quantitatively assess the predictive power of each PDF set and the contribution of the different sources of experimental and theoretical uncertainty to the agreement between data and predictions. We show that control over all of these aspects is crucial to precision physics studies, such as the determination of Standard Model parameters at the LHC.},

    abstract = {We report on the final electroweak measurements performed with data taken at the Z resonance by the experiments operating at the electron–positron colliders SLC and LEP. The data consist of 17 million Z decays accumulated by the ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL experiments at LEP, and 600 thousand Z decays by the SLD experiment using a polarised beam at SLC. The measurements include cross-sections, forward–backward asymmetries and polarised asymmetries. The mass and width of the Z boson, mZ and ΓZ, and its couplings to fermions, for example the ρ parameter and the effective electroweak mixing angle for leptons, are precisely measured:mZ=91.1875±0.0021GeV,ΓZ=2.4952±0.0023GeV,ρℓ=1.0050±0.0010,sin2θefflept=0.23153±0.00016.The number of light neutrino species is determined to be 2.9840±0.0082, in agreement with the three observed generations of fundamental fermions. The results are compared to the predictions of the Standard Model (SM). At the Z-pole, electroweak radiative corrections beyond the running of the QED and QCD coupling constants are observed with a significance of five standard deviations, and in agreement with the Standard Model. Of the many Z-pole measurements, the forward–backward asymmetry in b-quark production shows the largest difference with respect to its SM expectation, at the level of 2.8 standard deviations. Through radiative corrections evaluated in the framework of the Standard Model, the Z-pole data are also used to predict the mass of the top quark, mt=173-10+13GeV, and the mass of the W boson, mW=80.363±0.032GeV. These indirect constraints are compared to the direct measurements, providing a stringent test of the SM. Using in addition the direct measurements of mt and mW, the mass of the as yet unobserved SM Higgs boson is predicted with a relative uncertainty of about 50\% and found to be less than 285GeV at 95\% confidence level.},

    abstract = {We discuss the conditions for an effective field theory (EFT) to give an adequate low-energy description of an underlying physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Starting from the EFT where the SM is extended by dimension-6 operators, experimental data can be used without further assumptions to measure (or set limits on) the EFT parameters. The interpretation of these results requires instead a set of broad assumptions (e.g. power counting rules) on the UV dynamics. This allows one to establish, in a bottom-up approach, the validity range of the EFT description, and to assess the error associated with the truncation of the EFT series. We give a practical prescription on how experimental results could be reported, so that they admit a maximally broad range of theoretical interpretations. Namely, the experimental constraints on dimension-6 operators should be reported as functions of the kinematic variables that set the relevant energy scale of the studied process. This is especially important for hadron collider experiments where collisions probe a wide range of energy scales.},

The ATLAS and CMS experiments have improved their jet reconstruction and correction methods compared to Run I in order to better clean jets of the additional particles generated in pile-up interactions. Beyond jets formed from the hadronization of quarks and gluons, hadronic decays of highly boosted heavy particles, such as top quarks or Z, W or H bosons, in a single fat jet is gaining importance in the search for new physics at the highest possible energies. The LHC experiments have used the time between the LHC Run I and Run II to refine the methods used to identify such boosted decays and make them more robust in the presence of the high pile-up encountered in Run II. The application of this work to early Run II data are presented.},

Unfolding is traditionally done for individual, binned observables without including all information relevant for characterizing the detector response. We introduce OmniFold, an unfolding method that iteratively reweights a simulated dataset, using machine learning to capitalize on all available information. Our approach is unbinned, works for arbitrarily high-dimensional data, and naturally incorporates information from the full phase space. We illustrate this technique on a realistic jet substructure example from the Large Hadron Collider and compare it to standard binned unfolding methods. This new paradigm enables the simultaneous measurement of all observables, including those not yet invented at the time of the analysis.},

No physical predictions are affected, provided that the interaction part of the Hamiltonian is correspondingly modified. The fictitious elementary particle provides a good representation of a real composite particle if the modified interaction is sufficiently weakened for perturbation theory to work. It corresponds to a truly elementary particle with infinite bare mass, and hence with �� =0. We show how the latter condition yields a sum rule for the coupling of a composite particle to its constituents as a function of energy. The sum rule can be used to evaluate such coupling constants as that for the proton-electron-hydrogen vertex. The mathematical method used is that developed by Schmidt for the study of the Fredholm equation, and corresponds to the extraction of a single factor from the full Fredholm determinant.},

    abstract = {In this work, we consider ill-posed inverse problems in which the forward operator is continuous and weakly closed, and the sought solution belongs to a weakly closed constraint set. We propose a regularization method based on minimizing the Tikhonov functional on a sequence of compact sets which is dense in the intersection between the domain of the forward operator and the constraint set. The index of the compact sets can be interpreted as an additional regularization parameter. We prove that the proposed method is a regularization, achieving the same convergence rates as classical Tikhonov regularization and attaining the optimal convergence rate when the forward operator is linear. Moreover, we show that our methodology applies to the case where the constrained solution space is parametrized by means of neural networks (NNs), and the constraint is obtained by composing the last layer of the NN with a suitable activation function. In this case the dense compact sets are defined by taking a family of bounded weight NNs with increasing weight bound. Finally, we present some numerical experiments in the case of Computerized Tomography to compare the theoretical behavior of the reconstruction error with that obtained in a finite dimensional and non-asymptotic setting. The numerical tests also show that our NN-based regularization method is able to provide piece-wise constant solutions and to preserve the sharpness of edges, thus achieving lower reconstruction errors compared to the classical Tikhonov approach for the same level of noise in the data.},

The L-curve is a plot—for all valid regularization parameters—of the size of the regularized solution versus the size of the corresponding residual. Two main results are established. First a unifying characterization of various regularization methods is given and it is shown that the measurement of “size” is dependent on the particular regularization method chosen. For example, the 2-norm is appropriate for Tikhonov regularization, but a 1-norm in the coordinate system of the singular value decomposition (SVD) is relevant to truncated SVD regularization. Second, a new method is proposed for choosing the regularization parameter based on the L-curve, and it is shown how this method can be implemented efficiently. The method is compared to generalized cross validation and this new method is shown to be more robust in the presence of correlated errors.},

    abstract = {Inverse problems are a special kind of optimization problems because the cost function involves data, always affected by noise, that in the case of ill-conditioning is amplified back into the model parameters through the generalized inverse operator. Then, the inversion might provide spurious solutions if no regularization techniques are used. For a given misfit tolerance the models that fit the observed data are called equivalent, and are located in a region of the model space that is bounded by the linear hyper-quadric surface. This paper analyzes in detail the role of noise in data in linear inverse problems, providing a geometrical interpretation for the role of the regularization. The noise shifts the solution found by least squares methods and deforms homogeneously the topography of the cost function, while Tikhonov's regularization transforms the linear hyper-quadric from an elliptical cylinder to a very oblong hyper-ellipsoid in the directions that originally spanned the kernel of the linear forward operator. Furthermore, in the case of the regularization, this deformation is anisotropic affecting differently the axes of the linear hyper-quadric. The model of reference informs the coordinates of the solution that originally resided in the kernel of the forward operator. The differences with nonlinear inversion are highlighted in the second accompanying paper. This knowledge, although theoretical at this stage, might impact how the uncertainty analysis is performed in geophysical inversion, since noise in data is always present, and good prior models are not always available.},

However, a naive application of the standard regularization techniques to unfold the momentum spectrum of protons ejected in the process of negative muon nuclear capture led to a result exhibiting unphysical artifacts. A finite data sample limited the range in which unfolding can be performed, thus introducing a cutoff. A sharply falling “true” distribution led to low data statistics near the cutoff, which exacerbated the regularization bias and produced an unphysical spike in the resulting spectrum. An improved approach has been developed to address these issues and is illustrated using a toy model. The approach uses full Poisson likelihood of data, and produces a continuous, physically plausible, unfolded distribution. The new technique has a broad applicability since sharply falling spectra are common.},

Traditionally, unfolding is done by discretizing the target phase space into a finite number of bins and is limited in the number of unfolded variables. Recently, there have been a number of proposals to perform unbinned unfolding with machine learning. However, none of these methods (like most unfolding methods) allow for simultaneously constraining (profiling) nuisance parameters. We propose a new machine learning-based unfolding method that results in an unbinned differential cross section and can profile nuisance parameters. The machine learning loss function is the full likelihood function, based on binned inputs at detector level. We first demonstrate the method with simple Gaussian examples and then show the impact on a simulated Higgs boson cross section measurement.},

in association with the collision of two incoming high-energy particles,
but has several uses beyond that. The guiding philosophy is to produce
and re-produce properties of experimentally obtained collisions as
accurately as possible. The program includes a wide ranges of reactions
within and beyond the Standard Model, and extending to heavy ion
physics. Emphasis is put on phenomena where strong interactions play a
major role. The manual contains both pedagogical and practical
components. All included physics models are described in enough detail
to allow the user to obtain a cursory overview of used assumptions and
approximations, enabling an informed evaluation of the program output. A
number of the most central algorithms are described in enough detail
that the main results of the program can be reproduced independently,
allowing further development of existing models or the addition of new

    abstract = {The high energy physics unfolding problem is an important statistical inverse problem in data analysis at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The goal of unfolding is to make nonparametric inferences about a particle spectrum from measurements smeared by the finite resolution of the particle detectors. Previous unfolding methods use ad hoc discretization and regularization, resulting in confidence intervals that can have significantly lower coverage than their nominal level. Instead of regularizing using a roughness penalty or stopping iterative methods early, we impose physically motivated shape constraints: positivity, monotonicity, and convexity. We quantify the uncertainty by constructing a nonparametric confidence set for the true spectrum, consisting of all those spectra that satisfy the shape constraints and that predict the observations within an appropriately calibrated level of fit. Projecting that set produces simultaneous confidence intervals for all functionals of the spectrum, including averages within bins. The confidence intervals have guaranteed conservative frequentist finite-sample coverage in the important and challenging class of unfolding problems for steeply falling particle spectra. We demonstrate the method using simulations that mimic unfolding the inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum at the LHC. The shape-constrained intervals provide usefully tight conservative inferences, while the conventional methods suffer from severe undercoverage.},

We implement this method with the likelihood ratio (usually denoted as the Feldman-Cousins) approach with and without conditioning. We present studies of coverage for the likelihood ratio and Neyman ordering schemes. In particular, we present two different types of coverage tests for the case where systematic uncertainties are included. To illustrate the method we show the relative effect of including systematic uncertainties in the case of the dark matter search as performed by modern neutrino telescopes.},

The behavior of the technique is explored by applying it to roblems whose solutions are known in the limit of infinite sample size, and excellent results are obtained after a few iterations. The astronomical use of the technique is illustrated by applying it to the problem of rectifying distributions of v sin i for aspect effect; calculations are also reported illustrating the technique's possible use for correcting radio-astronomical observations for beam-smoothing. Application to the problem of obtaining unbiased, smoothed histograms is also suggested.},

The dominant uncertainty comes from the jet energy scale, which is determined to within 7\% for central jets above 60 GeV transverse momentum. Inclusive single-jet differential cross sections are presented as functions of jet transverse momentum and rapidity. Dijet cross sections are presented as functions of dijet mass and the angular variable χ.

It builds on the author's extensive research in the areas of time series and panel data analysis and covers a wide variety of topics in one volume. Different parts of the book can be used as teaching material for a variety of courses in econometrics. It can also be used as reference manual. It begins with an overview of basic econometric and statistical techniques, and provides an account of stochastic processes, univariate and multivariate time series, tests for unit roots, cointegration, impulse response analysis, autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models, simultaneous equation models, vector autoregressions, causality, forecasting, multivariate volatility models, panel data models, aggregation and global vector autoregressive models (GVAR).

    abstract = {Updating a truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is crucial in representation learning, especially when dealing with large-scale data matrices that continuously evolve in practical scenarios. Aligning SVD-based models with fast-paced updates becomes increasingly important. Existing methods for updating truncated SVDs employ Rayleigh-Ritz projection procedures, where projection matrices are augmented based on original singular vectors. However, these methods suffer from inefficiency due to the densification of the update matrix and the application of the projection to all singular vectors. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel method for dynamically approximating the truncated SVD of a sparse and temporally evolving matrix. Our approach leverages sparsity in the orthogonalization process of augmented matrices and utilizes an extended decomposition to independently store projections in the column space of singular vectors. Numerical experiments demonstrate a remarkable efficiency improvement of an order of magnitude compared to previous methods. Remarkably, this improvement is achieved while maintaining a comparable precision to existing approaches.},

Within the model, we give an algorithm for determining an estimate λ of λ which maximizes the probability p(n*{\textbar}λ) of observing the actual detector count data n* over all possible densities λ. Let independent Poisson variables n(b) with unknown means λ(b), b = 1, ···, B represent the number of unobserved emissions in each of B boxes (pixels) partitioning an object containing an emitter. Suppose each emission in box b is detected in detector unit d with probability p(b, d), d = 1, ···, D with p(b, d) a one-step transition matrix, assumed known. We observe the total number n* = n*(d) of emissions in each detector unit d and want to estimate the unknown λ = λ(b), b = 1, ···, B. For each λ, the observed data n* has probability or likelihood p(n*{\textbar}λ). The EM algorithm of mathematical statistics starts with an initial estimate λ0 and gives the following simple iterative procedure for obtaining a new estimate λnew, from an old estimate λold, to obtain Σk, k = 1, 2, ···, λnew(b)= λold(b) λDd=1 n*(d)p(b,d)/Σλold(bΣ)p(bλ,d),b=1,···B.},

    abstract = {The estimation of parameters from data is a common problem in many areas of the physical sciences, and frequently used algorithms rely on sets of simulated data which are fit to data. In this article, an analytic solution for simulation-based parameter estimation problems is presented. The matrix formalism, termed the Linear Template Fit, calculates the best estimators for the parameters of interest. It combines a linear regression with the method of least squares. The algorithm uses only predictions calculated for a few values of the parameters of interest, which have been made available prior to its execution. The Linear Template Fit is particularly suited for performance-critical applications and parameter estimation problems with computationally intense simulations, which are otherwise often limited in their usability for statistical inference. Equations for error propagation are discussed in detail and are given in closed analytic form. For the solution of problems with a nonlinear dependence on the parameters of interest, the Quadratic Template Fit is introduced. As an example application, a determination of the strong coupling constant from inclusive jet cross section data at the CERN Large Hadron Collider is studied and compared with previously published results.},

    abstract = {Nonlinear inverse problems in real problems in industry have typically a very underdetermined character due to the high number of parameters that are usually needed to achieve accurate forward predictions. The corresponding inverse problem is ill-posed, that is, there exist many solutions which are compatible with the prior information, fitting the observed data within the same error bounds. These solutions are located in (one or several) flat curvilinear and disconnected valleys of the cost function topography. The random sampling of these equivalent models is impossible due to the curse of dimensionality and to the high computational cost needed to provide the corresponding forward predictions. This paper generalizes the curse of dimensionality to linear and nonlinear inverse problems outlining the main differences between them. With a simple 2D example we show that nonlinearities allow for a reduction in size of the nonlinear equivalence region that could be embedded in a linear hyperquadric with smaller condition number than the corresponding linearized equivalence region. We also analyze the effect of the regularization in the posterior sampling, and that of the dimensionality reduction, which is needed to perform efficient sampling of the region of uncertainty equivalence in high dimensional problems. We hope that the additional theoretical knowledge provided by this research will help practitioners to design more efficient methods of sampling.},

    abstract = {Estimation of spatially-varying parameters for computationally expensive forward models governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is addressed. A novel multiscale Bayesian inference approach is introduced based on a multiscale deep generative model (MDGM). Such generative models provide a flexible representation and allow hierarchical parameter generation from coarse- to fine-scales. Combining the multiscale generative model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), inference across scales is achieved enabling us to obtain efficiently posterior parameter samples at various scales. To estimate the most salient features of parameters is essential in the proposed method. Inference of the fine-scale parameters is enabled by utilizing the posterior information in the immediate coarser scale. In this way, the global features are identified in the coarse-scale with the inference of low-dimensional variables and inexpensive forward computation, and the local features are refined and corrected in the fine-scale. The developed method is demonstrated with two types of permeability estimation for flow in heterogeneous media. One is a Gaussian random field (GRF) with uncertain length scales, and the other is channelized permeability with the two regions defined by different GRFs. The obtained results indicate that the method allows high-dimensional parameter estimation while exhibiting stability, efficiency, and accuracy.},

    abstract = {Under a Bayesian approach to a hierarchical model, quantile or interval estimation is often used to summarize the posterior distribution of a parameter. When using an Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm such as the Gibbs sampler to generate a sample from the posterior (marginal) of interest, calculations are often easier when done on a per-iteration (conditional) basis. Final estimators which are taken as a combination of values across iterations are often called “Rao–Blackwellized” and result in estimators with good variance properties. Such an approach is not yet used in the calculation of credible intervals. We derive here a weighted-average estimator of the endpoints of a credible interval which mimics this Rao–Blackwellized construction. We compare it to other alternatives including a naı̈ve average estimator, the usual order statistics estimator, and an estimator based on density estimation. We obtain theorems showing when there is convergence to the true interval and discuss Central Limit Theorems for these estimators. Simulations for two hierarchical modeling scenarios (count data and continuous data) illustrate their numerical behaviors. An animal epidemiology example is included. The proposed estimator offers the smallest standard errors of the estimators studied, sometimes by several orders of magnitude, but can have a small bias.},

What used to be a small minority of statisticians advocating for the use of priors and a strict adherence to bayes theorem, it is now becoming the norm across disciplines. The evolutionary direction is now clear. The trend is towards more realistic, flexible and complex likelihoods characterized by an ever increasing number of parameters. This makes the old question of: What should the prior be? to acquire a new central importance in the modern bayesian theory of inference. Entropic priors provide one answer to the problem of prior selection. The general definition of an entropic prior has existed since 1988 [1], but it was not until 1998 [2] that it was found that they provide a new notion of complete ignorance. This paper re-introduces the family of entropic priors as minimizers of mutual information between the data and the parameters, as in [2], but with a small change and a correction. The general formalism is then applied to two large classes of models: Discrete probabilistic networks and univariate finite mixtures of gaussians. It is also shown how to perform inference by efficiently sampling the corresponding posterior distributions.},

The resulting effect is that models that make sharp predictions are disfavoured, weakening the usual Bayesian “Occam’s Razor.” This is illustrated with a simple example involving what Jaynes called a “sure thing” hypothesis. Jaynes’ resolution of the situation involved introducing a large number of alternative “sure thing” hypotheses that were possible before we observed the data. However, in more complex situations, it may not be possible to explicitly enumerate large numbers of alternatives. The entropic priors formalism produces the desired result without modifying the hypothesis space or requiring explicit enumeration of alternatives; all that is required is a good model for the prior predictive distribution for the data. This idea is illustrated with a simple rigged‐lottery example, and we outline how this idea may help to resolve a recent debate amongst cosmologists: is dark energy a cosmological constant, or has it evolved with time in some way? And how shall we decide, when the data are in?},

    abstract = {Signal detection is one of the main challenges of data science. According to the nature of the data, the presence of noise may corrupt measurements and hinder the discovery of significant patterns. A wide range of techniques aiming at extracting the relevant degrees of freedom from data has been thus developed over the years. However, signal detection in almost continuous spectra, for small signal-to-noise ratios, remains a known difficult issue. This paper develops over recent advancements proposing to tackle this issue by analysing the properties of the underlying effective field theory arising as a sort of maximal entropy distribution in the vicinity of universal random matrix distributions. Nearly continuous spectra provide an intrinsic and non-conventional scaling law for field and couplings, the scaling dimensions depending on the energy scale. The coarse-graining over small eigenvalues of the empirical spectrum defines a specific renormalization group, whose characteristics change when the collective behaviour of "informational" modes become significant, that is, stronger than the intrinsic fluctuations of noise. This paper pursues three different goals. First, we propose to quantify the real effects of fluctuations relative to what can be called "signal", while improving the robustness of the results obtained in our previous work. Second, we show that quantitative changes in the presence of a signal result in a counterintuitive modification of the distribution of eigenvectors. Finally, we propose a method for estimating the number of noise components and define a limit of detection in a general nearly continuous spectrum using the renormalization group. The main statements of this paper are essentially numeric, and their reproducibility can be checked using the associated code.},

    abstract = {For estimating a lower bounded parametric function in the framework of Marchand and Strawderman (2006), we provide through a unified approach a class of Bayesian confidence intervals with credibility \$1-{\textbackslash}alpha\$ and frequentist coverage probability bounded below by \${\textbackslash}frac\{1-{\textbackslash}alpha\}\{1+{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$. In cases where the underlying pivotal distribution is symmetric, the findings represent extensions with respect to the specification of the credible set achieved through the choice of a \{{\textbackslash}it spending function\}, and include Marchand and Strawderman's HPD procedure result. For non-symmetric cases, the determination of a such a class of Bayesian credible sets fills a gap in the literature and includes an "equal-tails" modification of the HPD procedure. Several examples are presented demonstrating wide applicability.},

    abstract = {We propose a family of curvature-based regularization terms for deep generative model learning. Explicit coordinate-invariant formulas for both intrinsic and extrinsic curvature measures are derived for the case of arbitrary data manifolds embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean space. Because computing the curvature is a highly computation-intensive process involving the evaluation of second-order derivatives, efficient formulas are derived for approximately evaluating intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures. Comparative studies are conducted that compare the relative efficacy of intrinsic versus extrinsic curvature-based regularization measures, as well as performance comparisons against existing autoencoder training methods. Experiments involving noisy motion capture data confirm that curvature-based methods outperform existing autoencoder regularization methods, with intrinsic curvature measures slightly more effective than extrinsic curvature measures.},

    abstract = {State-of-the-art classifiers have been shown to be largely vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. One of the most effective strategies to improve robustness is adversarial training. In this paper, we investigate the effect of adversarial training on the geometry of the classification landscape and decision boundaries. We show in particular that adversarial training leads to a significant decrease in the curvature of the loss surface with respect to inputs, leading to a drastically more "linear" behaviour of the network. Using a locally quadratic approximation, we provide theoretical evidence on the existence of a strong relation between large robustness and small curvature. To further show the importance of reduced curvature for improving the robustness, we propose a new regularizer that directly minimizes curvature of the loss surface, and leads to adversarial robustness that is on par with adversarial training. Besides being a more efficient and principled alternative to adversarial training, the proposed regularizer confirms our claims on the importance of exhibiting quasi-linear behavior in the vicinity of data points in order to achieve robustness.},

This is a special case of the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available. The EMD also allows for partial matching. When used to compare distributions that have the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric, and has easy-to-compute lower bounds. In this paper we focus on applications to image databases, especially color and texture. We use the EMD to exhibit the structure of color-distribution and texture spaces by means of Multi-Dimensional Scaling displays. We also propose a novel approach to the problem of navigating through a collection of color images, which leads to a new paradigm for image database search.},

These data, taken with the H1 detector at HERA, are corrected for detector effects using an unbinned machine learning algorithm OmniFold, which considers eight observables simultaneously in this first application. The unfolded cross sections are compared to calculations performed within the context of collinear or transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as well as Monte Carlo event generators. The measurement probes a wide range of QCD phenomena, including TMD parton distribution functions and their evolution with energy in so far unexplored kinematic regions.},

    abstract = {\$Z\$ boson events at the Large Hadron Collider can be selected with high purity and are sensitive to a diverse range of QCD phenomena. As a result, these events are often used to probe the nature of the strong force, improve Monte Carlo event generators, and search for deviations from Standard Model predictions. All previous measurements of \$Z\$ boson production characterize the event properties using a small number of observables and present the results as differential cross sections in predetermined bins. In this analysis, a machine learning method called OmniFold is used to produce a simultaneous measurement of twenty-four \$Z\$+jets observables using \$139\$ fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ of proton-proton collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=13\$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector. Unlike any previous fiducial differential cross-section measurement, this result is presented unbinned as a dataset of particle-level events, allowing for flexible re-use in a variety of contexts and for new observables to be constructed from the twenty-four measured observables.},

    abstract = {Measurements of jet substructure are key to probing the energy frontier at colliders, and many of them use track-based observables which take advantage of the angular precision of tracking detectors. Theoretical calculations of track-based observables require `track functions', which characterize the transverse momentum fraction \$r\_q\$ carried by charged hadrons from a fragmenting quark or gluon. This letter presents a direct measurement of \$r\_q\$ distributions in dijet events from the 140 fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ of proton-proton collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=13\$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. The data are corrected for detector effects using machine-learning methods. The scale evolution of the moments of the \$r\_q\$ distribution is sensitive to non-linear renormalization group evolution equations of QCD, and is compared with analytic predictions. When incorporated into future theoretical calculations, these results will enable a precision program of theory-data comparison for track-based jet substructure observables.},

    abstract = {The radiation pattern within high energy quark- and gluon-initiated jets (jet substructure) is used extensively as a precision probe of the strong force as well as an environment for optimizing event generators with numerous applications in high energy particle and nuclear physics. Looking at electron-proton collisions is of particular interest as many of the complications present at hadron colliders are absent. A detailed study of modern jet substructure observables, jet angularities, in electron-proton collisions is presented using data recorded using the H1 detector at HERA. The measurement is unbinned and multi-dimensional, using machine learning to correct for detector effects. All of the available reconstructed object information of the respective jets is interpreted by a graph neural network, achieving superior precision on a selected set of jet angularities. Training these networks was enabled by the use of a large number of GPUs in the Perlmutter supercomputer at Berkeley Lab. The particle jets are reconstructed in the laboratory frame, using the \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$ jet clustering algorithm. Results are reported at high transverse momentum transfer \$Q{\textasciicircum}2{\textgreater}150\$ GeV\$\{\}{\textasciicircum}2\$, and inelasticity \$0.2 {\textless} y {\textless} 0.7\$. The analysis is also performed in sub-regions of \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$, thus probing scale dependencies of the substructure variables. The data are compared with a variety of predictions and point towards possible improvements of such models.},

When the average transverse momentum of the lepton-jet system, \${\textbackslash}lvert {\textbackslash}vec\{P\}\_{\textbackslash}perp {\textbackslash}rvert \$, is much larger than the total transverse momentum of the system, \${\textbackslash}lvert {\textbackslash}vec\{q\}\_{\textbackslash}perp {\textbackslash}rvert\$, the asymmetry between parallel and antiparallel configurations, \${\textbackslash}vec\{P\}\_{\textbackslash}perp\$ and \${\textbackslash}vec\{q\}\_{\textbackslash}perp\$, is expected to be generated by initial and final state soft gluon radiation and can be predicted using perturbation theory. Quantifying the angular properties of the asymmetry therefore provides an additional test of the strong force. Studying the asymmetry is important for future measurements of intrinsic asymmetries generated by the proton's constituents through Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), where this asymmetry constitutes a dominant background. Moments of the azimuthal asymmetries are measured using a machine learning method for unfolding that does not require binning.},

These modifications can be measured using observables like jet momentum profile and generalized angularities to study the details of jet-medium interactions. Jet momentum profile (\${\textbackslash}rho(r)\$) encodes radially differential information about jet broadening and has shown migration of charged energy towards the jet periphery in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Measurements of generalized angularities (girth \$g\$ and momentum dispersion \$p\_T{\textasciicircum}D\$) and LeSub (difference between leading and subleading constituents) from Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC show harder, or more quark-like jet fragmentation, in the presence of the medium.

However, such data-driven models may provide overly confident predictions with unknown errors and uncertainties. For reliable deployment of machine learning models in high-regret and safety-critical systems such as particle accelerators, estimates of prediction uncertainty are needed along with accurate point predictions. In this investigation, we evaluate Bayesian neural networks (BNN) as an approach that can provide accurate predictions along with reliably quantified uncertainties for particle accelerator problems, and compare their performance with bootstrapped ensembles of neural networks. We select three accelerator setups for this evaluation: a storage ring, a photoinjector, and a linac. The problems span different data volumes and dimensionalities (e.g., scalar predictions as well as image outputs). It is found that BNN provide accurate predictions of the mean along with reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty across the test cases. In this vein, BNN may offer an attractive alternative to deterministic deep learning tools to generate accurate predictions with quantified uncertainties in particle accelerator applications.},

By harnessing the latent-space structure of particle physics processes, we extract extra information from the simulator. This augmented data can be used to train neural networks that precisely estimate the likelihood ratio. The new methods scale well to many observables and high-dimensional parameter spaces, do not require any approximations of the parton shower and detector response, and can be evaluated in microseconds. Using weak-boson-fusion Higgs production as an example process, we compare the performance of several techniques. The best results are found for likelihood ratio estimators trained with extra information about the score, the gradient of the log likelihood function with respect to the theory parameters. The score also provides sufficient statistics that contain all the information needed for inference in the neighborhood of the Standard Model. These methods enable us to put significantly stronger bounds on effective dimension-six operators than the traditional approach based on histograms. They also outperform generic machine learning methods that do not make use of the particle physics structure, demonstrating their potential to substantially improve the new physics reach of the Large Hadron Collider legacy results.},

    abstract = {Many feedforward neural networks (NNs) generate continuous and piecewise-linear (CPWL) mappings. Specifically, they partition the input domain into regions on which the mapping is affine. The number of these so-called linear regions offers a natural metric to characterize the expressiveness of CPWL NNs. The precise determination of this quantity is often out of reach in practice, and bounds have been proposed for specific architectures, including for ReLU and Maxout NNs. In this work, we generalize these bounds to NNs with arbitrary and possibly multivariate CPWL activation functions. We first provide upper and lower bounds on the maximal number of linear regions of a CPWL NN given its depth, width, and the number of linear regions of its activation functions. Our results rely on the combinatorial structure of convex partitions and confirm the distinctive role of depth which, on its own, is able to exponentially increase the number of regions. We then introduce a complementary stochastic framework to estimate the average number of linear regions produced by a CPWL NN. Under reasonable assumptions, the expected density of linear regions along any 1D path is bounded by the product of depth, width, and a measure of activation complexity (up to a scaling factor). This yields an identical role to the three sources of expressiveness: no exponential growth with depth is observed anymore.},

    abstract = {We study the necessary and sufficient complexity of ReLU neural networks---in terms of depth and number of weights---which is required for approximating classifier functions in \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$. As a model class, we consider the set \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}beta ({\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}d)\$ of possibly discontinuous piecewise \$C{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}beta\$ functions \$f : [-1/2, 1/2]{\textasciicircum}d {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}mathbb R\$, where the different smooth regions of \$f\$ are separated by \$C{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}beta\$ hypersurfaces. For dimension \$d {\textbackslash}geq 2\$, regularity \${\textbackslash}beta {\textgreater} 0\$, and accuracy \${\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textgreater} 0\$, we construct artificial neural networks with ReLU activation function that approximate functions from \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}beta({\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}d)\$ up to \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$ error of \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$. The constructed networks have a fixed number of layers, depending only on \$d\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta\$, and they have \$O({\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-2(d-1)/{\textbackslash}beta\})\$ many nonzero weights, which we prove to be optimal. In addition to the optimality in terms of the number of weights, we show that in order to achieve the optimal approximation rate, one needs ReLU networks of a certain depth. Precisely, for piecewise \$C{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}beta({\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}d)\$ functions, this minimal depth is given---up to a multiplicative constant---by \${\textbackslash}beta/d\$. Up to a log factor, our constructed networks match this bound. This partly explains the benefits of depth for ReLU networks by showing that deep networks are necessary to achieve efficient approximation of (piecewise) smooth functions. Finally, we analyze approximation in high-dimensional spaces where the function \$f\$ to be approximated can be factorized into a smooth dimension reducing feature map \${\textbackslash}tau\$ and classifier function \$g\$---defined on a low-dimensional feature space---as \$f = g {\textbackslash}circ {\textbackslash}tau\$. We show that in this case the approximation rate depends only on the dimension of the feature space and not the input dimension.},

    abstract = {The expressive power of neural networks is important for understanding deep learning. Most existing works consider this problem from the view of the depth of a network. In this paper, we study how width affects the expressiveness of neural networks. Classical results state that depth-bounded (e.g. depth-\$2\$) networks with suitable activation functions are universal approximators. We show a universal approximation theorem for width-bounded ReLU networks: width-\$(n+4)\$ ReLU networks, where \$n\$ is the input dimension, are universal approximators. Moreover, except for a measure zero set, all functions cannot be approximated by width-\$n\$ ReLU networks, which exhibits a phase transition. Several recent works demonstrate the benefits of depth by proving the depth-efficiency of neural networks. That is, there are classes of deep networks which cannot be realized by any shallow network whose size is no more than an exponential bound. Here we pose the dual question on the width-efficiency of ReLU networks: Are there wide networks that cannot be realized by narrow networks whose size is not substantially larger? We show that there exist classes of wide networks which cannot be realized by any narrow network whose depth is no more than a polynomial bound. On the other hand, we demonstrate by extensive experiments that narrow networks whose size exceed the polynomial bound by a constant factor can approximate wide and shallow network with high accuracy. Our results provide more comprehensive evidence that depth is more effective than width for the expressiveness of ReLU networks.},

    abstract = {We introduce the "exponential linear unit" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10\% classification error for a single crop, single model network.},

Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities.

It integrates a Mixture Density Network for probabilistic modeling and physics knowledge as regularizations. This model can handle arbitrary distribution of data (e.g., strongly non-Gaussian, multi-mode, and truncated distributions). The physics knowledge from parameters and their partial derivatives is used as equality/ inequality constraints. The training of physics-guided machine learning is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. The constrained optimization problem is transformed to an unconstrained one using a dynamic penalty function algorithm. Thus, the commonly used backpropagation algorithm can be used to train the neural network. With the physics constraints, the required training data size can be reduced, and the overfitting problem can be mitigated. This paper demonstrates the application of the PgMDN using a numerical example, an engineering problem for fatigue stress-life curve estimation, an engineering problem for natural frequency prediction of bridges, and an engineering problem for fatigue life prediction of corroded steel reinforcing bars. Some discussions are given to illustrate the effectiveness of incorporating the physics knowledge when data are sparse, the improvement of the dynamic penalty function method compared with the static method, and the benefits achieved from the distribution mixture compared with a single Gaussian distribution.},

    abstract = {Accurate probabilistic predictions can be characterized by two properties -- calibration and sharpness. However, standard maximum likelihood training yields models that are poorly calibrated and thus inaccurate -- a 90\% confidence interval typically does not contain the true outcome 90\% of the time. This paper argues that calibration is important in practice and is easy to maintain by performing low-dimensional density estimation. We introduce a simple training procedure based on recalibration that yields calibrated models without sacrificing overall performance; unlike previous approaches, ours ensures the most general property of distribution calibration and applies to any model, including neural networks. We formally prove the correctness of our procedure assuming that we can estimate densities in low dimensions and we establish uniform convergence bounds. Our results yield empirical performance improvements on linear and deep Bayesian models and suggest that calibration should be increasingly leveraged across machine learning. We release a library that implements our methods along with a blog post here: https://shachideshpande.github.io/blog-distribution-calibration/.},

    abstract = {This work focuses on the task of emulating stochastic simulators that generate random results given consistent inputs. Existing stochastic surrogate models can have limitations in characterizing complex output distributions or suffer from data inefficiency and high-dimensionality issues. As a remedy, we propose to introduce Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) as an advanced stochastic surrogate model. Flexible neural networks are utilized to parametrize Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to capture complex input-dependent output conditional densities. MDNs, like typical neural networks, use multiple layers of nonlinear transformations to effectively manage the potentially high-dimensional or large-volume inputs. Statistically, MDNs eliminate the need for random seed control or replication by directly learning to maximize the training data likelihood. To further enhance MDN model robustness and mitigate over-fitting, we incorporate the hard parameter sharing and variance regularization technique, and Bayesian optimization to search for optimal MDN hyperparameters, unlocking its full potential as stochastic surrogates. The efficacy of our MDN stochastic surrogate model is illustrated through various academic and realistic examples. MDN is demonstrated to be consistently more flexible, accurate, and data-efficient than current stochastic surrogate workhorses.},

    abstract = {Although Gaussian processes (GPs) with deep kernels have been successfully used for meta-learning in regression tasks, its uncertainty estimation performance can be poor. We propose a meta-learning method for calibrating deep kernel GPs for improving regression uncertainty estimation performance with a limited number of training data. The proposed method meta-learns how to calibrate uncertainty using data from various tasks by minimizing the test expected calibration error, and uses the knowledge for unseen tasks. We design our model such that the adaptation and calibration for each task can be performed without iterative procedures, which enables effective meta-learning. In particular, a task-specific uncalibrated output distribution is modeled by a GP with a task-shared encoder network, and it is transformed to a calibrated one using a cumulative density function of a task-specific Gaussian mixture model (GMM). By integrating the GP and GMM into our neural network-based model, we can meta-learn model parameters in an end-to-end fashion. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves uncertainty estimation performance while keeping high regression performance compared with the existing methods using real-world datasets in few-shot settings.},

Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.},

For the sake of building a fast and accurate SCI recovery algorithm, we incorporate the interpretability of model-based methods and the speed of learning-based ones and present a novel dense deep unfolding network (DUN) with 3D-CNN prior for SCI, where each phase is unrolled from an iteration of Half-Quadratic Splitting (HQS). To better exploit the spatial-temporal correlation among frames and address the problem of information loss between adjacent phases in existing DUNs, we propose to adopt the 3D-CNN prior in our proximal mapping module and develop a novel dense feature map (DFM) strategy, respectively. Besides, in order to promote network robustness, we further propose a dense feature map adaption (DFMA) module to allow inter-phase information to fuse adaptively. All the parameters are learned in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on simulation data and real data verify the superiority of our method.

We demonstrate the usefulness of CNN by using a couple of physics examples from well motivated BSM scenarios predicting long-lived particles giving rise to displaced jets.

The comparative analysis results indicate that the CNN outperforms the PCA by about 40\% at 100 GeV in terms of angular resolution under isotropic conditions. Both methods are further validated using beam test data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CNN method in reconstructing the shower axis, and they underscore the potential of incorporating advanced deep learning techniques into the comprehensive task of calorimeter reconstruction.},

The whole framework is composed of two stages: stage-1 for the bottom-up 3D proposal generation and stage-2 for refining proposals in the canonical coordinates to obtain the final detection results. Instead of generating proposals from RGB image or projecting point cloud to bird's view or voxels as previous methods do, our stage-1 sub-network directly generates a small number of high-quality 3D proposals from point cloud in a bottom-up manner via segmenting the point cloud of the whole scene into foreground points and background. The stage-2 sub-network transforms the pooled points of each proposal to canonical coordinates to learn better local spatial features, which is combined with global semantic features of each point learned in stage-1 for accurate box refinement and confidence prediction. Extensive experiments on the 3D detection benchmark of KITTI dataset show that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods with remarkable margins by using only point cloud as input.
