	title        = {Search for Higgs boson production in association with top quarks and decaying into bottom quarks using deep learning techniques with the CMS experiment},
	DOI          = {10.18154/rwth-2019-06415},
	abstractNote = {After the discovery of the Higgs boson during the first run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), precise measurements of its properties and couplings to other particles are conducted by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Due to its high mass, the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) predicts that the top quark, among all fermions, exhibits the strongest coupling to the Higgs boson with a Yukawa coupling constant close to unity. Therefore, the accurate measurement of Higgs-top coupling is essential for probing predictions of the SM and to constrain theories that reach beyond it. This thesis presents a search for the associated production of a Higgs boson with a top quark pair at a center-of-mass energy of s = 13 TeV. The data from proton-proton collisions of the second run of the LHC was recorded by the CMS detector in 2016 and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The analysis focuses on events where the Higgs boson decays into a pair of bottom quarks and the decay of the tt\textasciimacron{} system involves one or two electrons or muons with opposite charge. In addition to the lepton requirements, events are selected to have missing transverse energy and at least four energetic jets of, which at least three must have a b tag. The analysis is dominated by systematic uncertainties in the normalization of tt\textasciimacron{} background contributions with additional heavy-flavor jets, especially from tt\textasciimacron{}+bb\textasciimacron{}, tt\textasciimacron{}+bb\textasciimacron{}, tt\textasciimacron{}+2b, and tt\textasciimacron{}+cc\textasciimacron{} production. To reduce their impact on the analysis, a novel event categorization scheme based on deep neural networks is introduced. In contrast to binary classification, the networks perform a multi-class classification, which attributes events with a probability to originate from either the signal process or a particular background process. The information of the highest probability is exploited to create mutually exclusive categories that are enriched with events of one of the considered physics processes. As the tt\textasciimacron{} +heavy-flavor normalization uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated in the signal extraction procedure, the simultaneous isolation of backgrounds using this approach leads to more accurate background constraints and, in turn, to a gain in signal sensitivity. Results are obtained in a simultaneous measurement over 24 orthogonal categories defined by the lepton channel, the number of jets, and the most probable process as attributed by the deep neural networks. In each category, the distribution of the network output unit that corresponds to the assigned process category is fitted to data. The best fit value of the tt\textasciimacron{}H signal strength modifier \ensuremath{\mu} = \ensuremath{\sigma}/\ensuremath{\sigma}SM is extracted in a profile likelihood fit with systematic uncertainties incorporated as nuisance parameters. Upper limits on \ensuremath{\mu} are computed using the asymptotic CLS method at 95\% confidence level. The SM predicts a tt\textasciimacron{}H production cross section of \ensuremath{\sigma}SM = 507-50+35 fb with NLO QCD accuracy and NLO electroweak corrections. This analysis measures an observed upper limit on the tt\textasciimacron{}H signal strength modifier of \ensuremath{\mu}obs< 1.85, which excludes greater values with 95\% confidence given the measured data. The background-only hypothesis is disfavored due to an expected limit of \ensuremath{\mu}exp< 0.99-0.29+0.42 in case of a signal strength as predicted by the SM. The observed best fit value is measured as \ensuremath{\mu}obs = 0.98-0.48+0.50 = 0.98-0.25+0.26 (stat.)-0.41+0.43 (syst.). A value of \ensuremath{\mu}exp = 1.00-0.49+0.55 is expected from simulation. The corresponding observed (expected) significance amounts to 2.04 (1.92) standard deviations above the expected background. The total uncertainty predominantly originates from systematic effects. The analysis in the semi-lepton channel as presented in this thesis contributed to the first observations of both tt\textasciimacron{}H production and Higgs bosons decaying into bottom quarks, performed with the CMS experiment.},

This approach considers a fuller space of possible functions, is robust at increasing luminosity, and allows us to incorporate our understanding of the underlying physics. We demonstrate the application of this approach to modeling the background to searches for dijet resonances at the Large Hadron Collider and describe how the approach can be used in the search for generic localized signals.},

    abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 2,873 new measurements from 758 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 118 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Neutrinos in Cosmology. Starting with this edition, the Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and all review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings. Review articles that were previously part of the Listings are now included in volume 1. The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (http://pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is also available.

This article introduces MoreFit, which aims to provide a more optimised, rapid and efficient fitting solution for unbinned maximum likelihood fits. MoreFit is developed with a focus on parallelism and relies on computation graphs that are compiled just-in-time. Several novel automatic optimisation techniques are employed on the computation graphs that significantly increase performance compared to conventional approaches. MoreFit can make efficient use of a wide range of heterogeneous platforms through its compute backends that rely on open standards. It provides an OpenCL backend for execution on GPUs of all major vendors, and a backend based on LLVM and Clang for single- or multithreaded execution on CPUs, which in addition allows for SIMD vectorisation. MoreFit is benchmarked against several other fitting frameworks and shows very promising performance, illustrating the power of the approach.},

While a variety of powerful methods are available if the dimensionality of the feature space is small, such tests rapidly lose power as the dimensionality increases and the data inevitably become sparse. Machine learning classifiers are powerful tools capable of reducing highly multivariate problems into univariate ones, on which commonly used tests such as \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ or Kolmogorov-Smirnov may be applied. We explore applying both traditional and machine-learning-based tests to several example problems, and study how the power of each approach depends on the dimensionality. A pedagogical discussion is provided on which types of problems are best suited to using traditional versus machine-learning-based tests, and on the how to properly employ the machine-learning-based approach.},

Our primary focus is constraining the Wilson coefficients in the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT), but the methodology applies to broader parametric models of phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). We elevate the well-established procedures for binned Poisson counting experiments to the unbinned case by utilizing machine-learned surrogates of the likelihood ratio. This approach can be applied to various theoretical, modeling, and experimental uncertainties. By establishing a common statistical framework for BSM and systematic effects, we lay the groundwork for future unbinned analyses at the LHC. Additionally, we introduce a novel tree-boosting algorithm capable of learning highly accurate parameterizations of systematic effects. This algorithm extends the existing toolkit with a versatile and robust alternative. We demonstrate our approach using the example of an SMEFT interpretation of highly energetic top quark pair production in proton-proton collisions.},

We then review new simulation-based inference methods that let us directly analyze high-dimensional data by combining machine learning techniques and information from the simulator. Initial studies indicate that these techniques have the potential to substantially improve the precision of LHC measurements. Finally, we discuss probabilistic programming, an emerging paradigm that lets us extend inference to the latent process of the simulator.},

We apply these techniques to a specific class of statistical model that can incorporate uncertainties in parameters that themselves represent uncertainties (informally, "errors on errors") called the Gamma Variance Model. This model contains fixed parameters, generically called \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$, that represent the relative uncertainties in estimates of standard deviations of Gaussian distributed measurements. If the \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ parameters are small, one can construct confidence intervals and \$p\$-values using standard asymptotic methods. This is formally similar to the familiar situation of a large data sample, in which estimators for all adjustable parameters have Gaussian distributions. Here we address the important case where the \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ parameters are not small and as a consequence the asymptotic distributions do not represent a good approximation. We investigate improved test statistics based on the technology of higher-order asymptotics (\$p{\textasciicircum}*\$ approximation and Bartlett correction).},

    abstract = {A group of techniques known by the general name of single-molecule localization microscopy reaches a nanometer-scale spatial resolution of point light emitters, well below the diffraction limit of the traditional microscopy. The key feature of these techniques is blinking, alternation of bright and dark states, of each emitter so that no more than one emitter is bright within the width of the point-spread function of the microscope during a time sufficient for its localization. We give a formulation of the optical part of these techniques in terms of quantum metrology, where the limit of precision is determined by the Fisher information on the emitters positions contained in the measurement data. We show that the advantage in resolution provided by making the emitters blink is a consequence of the fundamental property of Fisher information, its convexity. In particular, we prove the weak matrix convexity and the trace convexity of the Fisher information matrix -- two fundamental results in the multiparameter estimation theory. We show also that the advantage in information is inherent to the quantum state of light itself before the measurement and is related to the convexity of the quantum Fisher information matrix.},

Model-independence is enforced by avoiding any prior assumption about the presence or shape of new physics components in the measurements.

The main sources of non-statistical fluctuations are characterized based purely on experimental data with an unbiased method, as well as by using single high \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ particles and simulated jets embedded into real Pb-Pb events and reconstructed with the anti-\$k\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ jet finder. The influence of a low transverse momentum cut-off on particles used in the jet reconstruction is quantified by varying the minimum track \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ between 0.15 GeV/\$c\$ and 2 GeV/\$c\$. For embedded jets reconstructed from charged particles with \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\} {\textgreater} 0.15\$ GeV/\$c\$, the uncertainty in the reconstructed jet transverse momentum due to the heavy-ion background is measured to be 11.3 GeV/\$c\$ (standard deviation) for the 10\% most central Pb-Pb collisions, slightly larger than the value of 11.0 GeV/\$c\$ measured using the unbiased method. For a higher particle transverse momentum threshold of 2 GeV/\$c\$, which will generate a stronger bias towards hard fragmentation in the jet finding process, the standard deviation of the fluctuations in the reconstructed jet transverse momentum is reduced to 4.8-5.0 GeV/\$c\$ for the 10\% most central events. A non-Gaussian tail of the momentum uncertainty is observed and its impact on the reconstructed jet spectrum is evaluated for varying particle momentum thresholds, by folding the measured fluctuations with steeply falling spectra.},

Further corrections, depending on the jet flavor and distance parameter (jet size) R, are also presented. The jet energy resolution is measured in data and simulated events and is studied as a function of pileup, jet size, and jet flavor. Typical jet energy resolutions at the central rapidities are 15-20\% at 30 GeV, about 10\% at 100 GeV, and 5\% at 1 TeV. The studies exploit events with dijet topology, as well as photon+jet, Z+jet and multijet events. Several new techniques are used to account for the various sources of jet energy scale corrections, and a full set of uncertainties, and their correlations, are provided. The final uncertainties on the jet energy scale are below 3\% across the phase space considered by most analyses (pT {\textgreater} 30 GeV and abs(eta) {\textless} 5.0). In the barrel region (abs(eta) {\textless} 1.3) an uncertainty below 1\% for pT {\textgreater} 30 GeV is reached, when excluding the jet flavor uncertainties, which are provided separately for different jet flavors. A new benchmark for jet energy scale determination at hadron colliders is achieved with 0.32\% uncertainty for jets with pT of the order of 165-330 GeV, and abs(eta) {\textless} 0.8.},

    abstract = {At the start of Run 2 in 2015, the LHC delivered proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. During Run 2 (years 2015-2018) the LHC eventually reached a luminosity of 2.1 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{34\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, almost three times that reached during Run 1 (2009-2013) and a factor of two larger than the LHC design value, leading to events with up to a mean of about 50 simultaneous inelastic proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing (pileup). The CMS Level-1 trigger was upgraded prior to 2016 to improve the selection of physics events in the challenging conditions posed by the second run of the LHC. This paper describes the performance of the CMS Level-1 trigger upgrade during the data taking period of 2016-2018. The upgraded trigger implements pattern recognition and boosted decision tree regression techniques for muon reconstruction, includes pileup subtraction for jets and energy sums, and incorporates pileup-dependent isolation requirements for electrons and tau leptons. In addition, the new trigger calculates high-level quantities such as the invariant mass of pairs of reconstructed particles. The upgrade reduces the trigger rate from background processes and improves the trigger efficiency for a wide variety of physics signals.},

    abstract = {The existing CMS endcap calorimeters will be replaced with a High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) for operation at the High Luminosity (HL) LHC. Radiation hardness and excellent physics performance will be achieved by utilising silicon pad sensors and SiPM-on-scintillator tiles with high longitudinal and transverse segmentation. One of the major challenges of the HL-LHC will be the high pileup environment, with interaction vertices spread not only in position, but also in time. In order to efficiently reject particles originating from pileup, precision timing information of the order of 30 ps will be of great benefit. In order to meet such performance goals, the HGCAL will provide timing measurements for individual hits with signals above 12 fC (equivalent to 3-10 MIPs), such that clusters resulting from particles with \$p\_T\$ {\textgreater} 5 GeV should have a timing resolution better than 30 ps. Given the complexity and size of the system, this poses a particular challenge to the readout electronics as well as to the calibration and reconstruction procedures. We present the challenges for the front-end electronics design, results from prototype tests in laboratory and beam environments, as well as anticipated timing performance from simulation.},

The model is of particular use in analyses that combine the results of several measurements. In the past, combinations have been carried out using two alternative approaches: the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) method or what we will call the nuisance-parameter method. In this paper we derive useful relations that allow one to connect the BLUE and nuisance-parameter methods when the correlations induced by systematic uncertainties are non-trivial (1, -1 or 0), and we generalise the nuisance-parameter approach to include errors-on-errors. We then illustrate some of the properties of the GVM by applying it to the 7-8 TeV ATLAS-CMS top quark mass combination. We present results by considering the largest systematic uncertainties as uncertain, one at a time, and we vary their associated error-on-error parameters. This procedure is useful for identifying the systematic uncertainties to which a combination is sensitive when they are themselves uncertain. We also explore the hypothetical scenario of including an outlier in the combination, which could become relevant for future combinations, by artificially adding a fictitious measurement to it. This example highlights a key feature of the GVM: its sensitivity to the internal consistency of the input data.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance/ these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a 'generative model' for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are 'nuisance parameters' to marginalize away.},

    abstract = {The advent of large data-set in cosmology has meant that in the past 10 or 20 years our knowledge and understanding of the Universe has changed not only quantitatively but also, and most importantly, qualitatively. Cosmologists rely on data where a host of useful information is enclosed, but is encoded in a non-trivial way. The challenges in extracting this information must be overcome to make the most of a large experimental effort. Even after having converged to a standard cosmological model (the LCDM model) we should keep in mind that this model is described by 10 or more physical parameters and if we want to study deviations from it, the number of parameters is even larger. Dealing with such a high dimensional parameter space and finding parameters constraints is a challenge on itself. Cosmologists want to be able to compare and combine different data sets both for testing for possible disagreements (which could indicate new physics) and for improving parameter determinations. Finally, cosmologists in many cases want to find out, before actually doing the experiment, how much one would be able to learn from it. For all these reasons, sophisiticated statistical techniques are being employed in cosmology, and it has become crucial to know some statistical background to understand recent literature in the field. I will introduce some statistical tools that any cosmologist should know about in order to be able to understand recently published results from the analysis of cosmological data sets. I will not present a complete and rigorous introduction to statistics as there are several good books which are reported in the references. The reader should refer to those.},

    abstract = {We investigate a spatially flat FLRW cosmological model in the framework of modified gravity described by the function {\textbackslash}( f(R, L\_m) = αR + L\_m{\textasciicircum}β+ γ{\textbackslash}), where {\textbackslash}( L\_m {\textbackslash}) is the matter Lagrangian density. The modified Friedmann equations yield the Hubble parameter as \$ H(z) = H\_0 {\textbackslash}sqrt\{(1 - λ) + λ(1 + z){\textasciicircum}\{3(1 + w)\}\},\$ with the parameters {\textbackslash}( λ= {\textbackslash}fracγ\{6αH\_0{\textasciicircum}2\} + 1 {\textbackslash}) and {\textbackslash}( w = {\textbackslash}frac\{β(n - 2) + 1\}\{2β- 1\} {\textbackslash}). Using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we constrain the model parameters with recent observational data, including cosmic chronometers, the Pantheon+ Supernovae dataset, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters. The best-fit values are found to be {\textbackslash}( H\_0 = 72.773{\textasciicircum}\{+0.148\}\_\{-0.152\} {\textbackslash}) km/s/Mpc, {\textbackslash}( λ= 0.289{\textasciicircum}\{+0.007\}\_\{-0.007\} {\textbackslash}), and {\textbackslash}( w = -0.002{\textasciicircum}\{+0.002\}\_\{-0.002\} {\textbackslash}), all quoted at the 1{\textbackslash}(σ{\textbackslash}) confidence level.This model predicts a transition redshift of {\textbackslash}( z\_t {\textbackslash}approx 0.76 {\textbackslash}) for the onset of cosmic acceleration and an estimated universe age of 13.21 Gyr. The higher inferred value of {\textbackslash}( H\_0 {\textbackslash}) compared to the Planck 2018 result offers a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Additionally, using {\textbackslash}( ρ\_0 = 0.534 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-30\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}text\{g/cm\}{\textasciicircum}3 {\textbackslash}) and assuming {\textbackslash}( n = 1 {\textbackslash}), we derive the model constants as {\textbackslash}( β= 1.00201 {\textbackslash}), {\textbackslash}( α= 512247 {\textbackslash}), and {\textbackslash}( γ= -1.215 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-29\} {\textbackslash}). We also evaluate the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to compare the model's performance with that of the standard {\textbackslash}(Λ{\textbackslash})CDM model. The small BIC difference ({\textbackslash}( Δ{\textbackslash}text\{BIC\} = 0.16 {\textbackslash})) indicates comparable statistical support for both models. Thus, the {\textbackslash}( f(R, L\_m) {\textbackslash}) gravity scenario serves as a consistent and viable alternative to {\textbackslash}(Λ{\textbackslash})CDM, potentially addressing open questions in late-time cosmology.},

We use the profile-likelihood ratio for statistical inference and focus on the case in which the model is determined from Monte Carlo simulated samples of finite size. We start by presenting a toy model in which the asymptotic properties of the profile-likelihood ratio are manifestly broken even if the numbers of events per bin in both the data and simulated samples are seemingly large enough to warrant their validity. We then move to the general setting to show how statistical uncertainties in the Monte Carlo predictions can affect the coverage of confidence intervals constructed in the asymptotic approximation always in the same direction, namely they lead to systematic under-coverage.},

When observations are correlated or clustered, results obtained from the standard software require adjustment. This tutorial compares two approaches, using examples that illustrate various designs for both independent and clustered data. One approach obtains initial estimates using software that assume independence among observations, then adjusts these estimates using a design effect (DE), also called a variance inflation factor (VIF). A second approach generates estimates using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) that account directly for patterns of clustering and correlation. The two approaches generally produce similar estimates and so validate one another. For certain clustered designs, small differences in power estimates emphasize the importance of specifying an alternative hypothesis in terms of means but also in terms of expected variances and covariances. Both approaches to power estimation are sensitive to assumptions concerning the structure or pattern of independence or correlation among clustered outcomes.},

    abstract = {In this article, we develop methods for sample size and power calculations in four-level intervention studies when intervention assignment is carried out at any level, with a particular focus on cluster randomized trials (CRTs). CRTs involving four levels are becoming popular in health care research, where the effects are measured, for example, from evaluations (level 1) within participants (level 2) in divisions (level 3) that are nested in clusters (level 4). In such multi-level CRTs, we consider three types of intraclass correlations between different evaluations to account for such clustering: that of the same participant, that of different participants from the same division, and that of different participants from different divisions in the same cluster. Assuming arbitrary link and variance functions, with the proposed correlation structure as the true correlation structure, closed-form sample size formulas for randomization carried out at any level (including individually randomized trials within a four-level clustered structure) are derived based on the generalized estimating equations approach using the model-based variance and using the sandwich variance with an independence working correlation matrix. We demonstrate that empirical power corresponds well with that predicted by the proposed method for as few as 8 clusters, when data are analyzed using the matrix-adjusted estimating equations for the correlation parameters with a bias-corrected sandwich variance estimator, under both balanced and unbalanced designs.},

    abstract = {Cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) are a well-established class of designs for evaluating large-scale, community-based research questions. An essential task in planning these trials is determining the required number of clusters and cluster sizes to achieve sufficient statistical power for detecting a clinically relevant effect size. Compared to methods for evaluating the average treatment effect (ATE) for the entire study population, there is more recent development of sample size methods for testing the heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTEs), i.e., modification of treatment effects by subpopulation characteristics, in CRTs. For confirmatory analyses of HTEs in CRTs, effect modifiers must be pre-specified, and ideally, accompanied by sample size or power calculations to ensure the trial has adequate power for the planned analyses. Power analysis for HTE analyses is more complex than for ATEs due to the additional design parameters that must be specified. Power and sample size formulas for HTE analyses have been separately derived under several cluster-randomized designs, including single and multi-period parallel designs, crossover designs, and stepped-wedge designs, as well as under continuous and binary outcomes. This tutorial provides a consolidated reference guide for these methods and enhances their accessibility through the development of an online R Shiny calculator. We further discuss key considerations for researchers conducting sample size and power calculations for testing pre-specified HTE hypotheses in CRTs, including the essential role of advance estimates of intracluster correlation coefficients for both outcomes and covariates on power. The sample size methodology and calculator functionality are demonstrated through real CRT examples.},

Using the UCI Combined Cycle Power Plant Dataset, we establishthe superiority of IG-based models over traditional approaches through rigorous statistical testing and model validation.

To correct for this, an asymptotically efficient, rescaled partial trace estimator is proposed. Motivated by this rescaling, we introduce an orthogonal parameterization for the set of Kronecker covariances. High-dimensional consistency results using the partial trace estimator are obtained that demonstrate a blessing of dimensionality. In settings where an array has at least order three, it is shown that as the array dimensions jointly increase, it is possible to consistently estimate the Kronecker covariance matrix, even when the sample size is one.},

To address this, we propose an adjustment that mitigates this inflation by employing full-rank covariance matrices. Through simulations, we validate the effectiveness of this adjustment in controlling false sign rates, thereby improving the robustness of empirical Bayes methods in high-dimensional settings. Our results show that the rank of the prior covariance matrix directly influences the accuracy of sign estimation and the performance of the lfsr, with significant implications for large-scale hypothesis testing in statistics and genomics.},

    abstract = {Composite likelihood provides approximate inference when the full likelihood is intractable and sub-likelihood functions of marginal events can be evaluated relatively easily. It has been successfully applied for many complex models. However, its wider application is limited by two issues. First, weight selection of marginal likelihood can have a significant impact on the information efficiency and is currently an open question. Second, calibrated Bayesian inference with composite likelihood requires curvature adjustment which is difficult for dependent data. This work shows that approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) can properly address these two issues by using multiple composite score functions as summary statistics. First, the summary-based posterior distribution gives the optimal Godambe information among a wide class of estimators defined by linear combinations of estimating functions. Second, to make ABC computationally feasible for models where marginal likelihoods have no closed form, a novel approach is proposed to estimate all simulated marginal scores using a Monte Carlo sample with size N. Sufficient conditions are given for the additional noise to be negligible with N fixed as the data size n goes to infinity, and the computational cost is O(n). Third, asymptotic properties of ABC with summary statistics having heterogeneous convergence rates is derived, and an adaptive scheme to choose the component composite scores is proposed. Numerical studies show that the new method significantly outperforms the existing Bayesian composite likelihood methods, and the efficiency of adaptively combined composite scores well approximates the efficiency of particle MCMC using the full likelihood.},

    abstract = {Elo rating, widely used for skill assessment across diverse domains ranging from competitive games to large language models, is often understood as an incremental update algorithm for estimating a stationary Bradley-Terry (BT) model. However, our empirical analysis of practical matching datasets reveals two surprising findings: (1) Most games deviate significantly from the assumptions of the BT model and stationarity, raising questions on the reliability of Elo. (2) Despite these deviations, Elo frequently outperforms more complex rating systems, such as mElo and pairwise models, which are specifically designed to account for non-BT components in the data, particularly in terms of win rate prediction. This paper explains this unexpected phenomenon through three key perspectives: (a) We reinterpret Elo as an instance of online gradient descent, which provides no-regret guarantees even in misspecified and non-stationary settings. (b) Through extensive synthetic experiments on data generated from transitive but non-BT models, such as strongly or weakly stochastic transitive models, we show that the ''sparsity'' of practical matching data is a critical factor behind Elo's superior performance in prediction compared to more complex rating systems. (c) We observe a strong correlation between Elo's predictive accuracy and its ranking performance, further supporting its effectiveness in ranking.},

The putative particle is a neutral scalar, \$S\$, with a mass of about 151 GeV. The reported significances are \$5.1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ local and \$4.8{\textbackslash}sigma\$ global. This nearly reaches the \$5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ threshold for a discovery in high-energy physics. In this brief note we cast doubt on the strength of the evidence for a new particle.

In the present paper the structure of small sample tests, whether these are related to problems of estimation and fiducial distributions, or are of the nature of tests of goodness of fit, is considered further. The notation a {\textbar} b implies as before that the variate a is conditioned by a given value of b. The fixed variate b may be denoted by {\textbar} b, and analogously if b is clear from the context, a {\textbar} b may be written simply as a {\textbar}. Corresponding to the idea of ancillary information introduced by Fisher for the case of a single unknown θ, where auxiliary statistics control the accuracy of our estimate, I have termed a conditional statistic of the form T {\textbar}, quasi-sufficient, if its distribution satisfies the “sufficiency” property and contains all the information on θ. In the more general case of other unknowns, such a statistic may contain all the available information on θ.},

    abstract = {Consider a binary mixture model of the form \$F\_{\textbackslash}theta = (1-{\textbackslash}theta)F\_0 + {\textbackslash}theta F\_1\$, where \$F\_0\$ is standard Gaussian and \$F\_1\$ is a completely specified heavy-tailed distribution with the same support. For a sample of \$n\$ independent and identically distributed values \$X\_i {\textbackslash}sim F\_{\textbackslash}theta\$, the maximum likelihood estimator \${\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\_n\$ is asymptotically normal provided that \$0 {\textless} {\textbackslash}theta {\textless} 1\$ is an interior point. This paper investigates the large-sample behaviour for boundary points, which is entirely different and strikingly asymmetric for \${\textbackslash}theta=0\$ and \${\textbackslash}theta=1\$. The reason for the asymmetry has to do with typical choices such that \$F\_0\$ is an extreme boundary point and \$F\_1\$ is usually not extreme. On the right boundary, well known results on boundary parameter problems are recovered, giving \${\textbackslash}lim {\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_1({\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\_n {\textless} 1)=1/2\$. On the left boundary, \${\textbackslash}lim{\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_0({\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\_n {\textgreater} 0)=1-1/{\textbackslash}alpha\$, where \$1{\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}leq 2\$ indexes the domain of attraction of the density ratio \$f\_1(X)/f\_0(X)\$ when \$X{\textbackslash}sim F\_0\$. For \${\textbackslash}alpha=1\$, which is the most important case in practice, we show how the tail behaviour of \$F\_1\$ governs the rate at which \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_0({\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\_n {\textgreater} 0)\$ tends to zero. A new limit theorem for the joint distribution of the sample maximum and sample mean conditional on positivity establishes multiple inferential anomalies. Most notably, given \${\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\_n {\textgreater} 0\$, the likelihood ratio statistic has a conditional null limit distribution \$G{\textbackslash}neq{\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\_1\$ determined by the joint limit theorem. We show through this route that no advantage is gained by extending the single distribution \$F\_1\$ to the nonparametric composite mixture generated by the same tail-equivalence class.},

This is usually achieved through twin studies by assessing the collective genetic impact defined by the differential correlation in monozygotic twins vs dizygotic twins. Since the underlying order in a twin, determined by latent genetic factors, is unknown, the observed twin data are unordered. Conventional methods for correlation are not appropriate. To handle the missing order, we model twin data by a mixture bivariate distribution and estimate under two likelihood functions: the likelihood over the monozygotic and dizygotic twins separately, and the likelihood over the two twin types combined. Both likelihood estimators are consistent. More importantly, the combined likelihood overcomes the drawback of mixture distribution estimation, namely, the slow convergence. It yields correlation coefficient estimator of root-n consistency and allows effective statistical inference on the collective genetic impact. The method is demonstrated by a twin study on immune traits.},

Indeed, it allows to reach point estimates, to assess their precision, to set up tests along with measures of evidence for statements of the type "\${\textbackslash}psi {\textgreater} {\textbackslash}psi\_0\$" or "\${\textbackslash}psi\_1 {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}psi {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}psi\_2\$", to derive confidence intervals, comparing the parameter of interest with other parameters from other studies, etc. The aim of this contribution is to discuss robust confidence distributions derived from unbiased \$M-\$estimating functions, which provide robust inference for \${\textbackslash}psi\$ when the assumed distribution is just an approximate parametric model or in the presence of deviant values in the observed data. Paralleling likelihood-based results and extending results available for robust scoring rules, we first illustrate how robust confidence distributions can be derived from the asymptotic theory of robust pivotal quantities. Then, we discuss the derivation of robust confidence distributions via simulation methods. An application and a simulation study are illustrated in the context of non-inferiority testing, in which null hypotheses of the form \$H\_0: {\textbackslash}psi {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}psi\_0\$ are of interest.},

    abstract = {Continuous response variables often need to be transformed to meet regression modeling assumptions; however, finding the optimal transformation is challenging and results may vary with the choice of transformation. When a continuous response variable is measured repeatedly for a subject or the continuous responses arise from clusters, it is more challenging to model the continuous response data due to correlation within clusters. We extend a widely used ordinal regression model, the cumulative probability model (CPM), to fit clustered continuous response variables based on generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods for ordinal responses. With our approach, estimates of marginal parameters, cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), expectations, and quantiles conditional on covariates can be obtained without pre-transformation of the potentially skewed continuous response data. Computational challenges arise with large numbers of distinct values of the continuous response variable, and we propose two feasible and computationally efficient approaches to fit CPMs for clustered continuous response variables with different working correlation structures. We study finite sample operating characteristics of the estimators via simulation, and illustrate their implementation with two data examples. One studies predictors of CD4:CD8 ratios in an HIV study. The other uses data from The Lung Health Study to investigate the contribution of a single nucleotide polymorphism to lung function decline.},

    abstract = {While widely used as a general method for uncertainty quantification, the bootstrap method encounters difficulties that raise concerns about its validity in practical applications. This paper introduces a new resampling-based method, termed \${\textbackslash}textit\{calibrated bootstrap\}\$, designed to generate finite sample-valid parametric inference from a sample of size \$n\$. The central idea is to calibrate an \$m\$-out-of-\$n\$ resampling scheme, where the calibration parameter \$m\$ is determined against inferential pivotal quantities derived from the cumulative distribution functions of loss functions in parameter estimation. The method comprises two algorithms. The first, named \${\textbackslash}textit\{resampling approximation\}\$ (RA), employs a \${\textbackslash}textit\{stochastic approximation\}\$ algorithm to find the value of the calibration parameter \$m=m\_{\textbackslash}alpha\$ for a given \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ in a manner that ensures the resulting \$m\$-out-of-\$n\$ bootstrapped \$1-{\textbackslash}alpha\$ confidence set is valid. The second algorithm, termed \${\textbackslash}textit\{distributional resampling\}\$ (DR), is developed to further select samples of bootstrapped estimates from the RA step when constructing \$1-{\textbackslash}alpha\$ confidence sets for a range of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ values is of interest. The proposed method is illustrated and compared to existing methods using linear regression with and without \$L\_1\$ penalty, within the context of a high-dimensional setting and a real-world data application. The paper concludes with remarks on a few open problems worthy of consideration.},

    abstract = {Mechanistic dynamic models of biochemical networks such as Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) contain unknown parameters like the reaction rate constants and the initial concentrations of the compounds. The large number of parameters as well as their nonlinear impact on the model responses hamper the determination of confidence regions for parameter estimates. At the same time, classical approaches translating the uncertainty of the parameters into confidence intervals for model predictions are hardly feasible. In this article it is shown that a so-called prediction profile likelihood yields reliable confidence intervals for model predictions, despite arbitrarily complex and high-dimensional shapes of the confidence regions for the estimated parameters. Prediction confidence intervals of the dynamic states allow a data-based observability analysis. The approach renders the issue of sampling a high-dimensional parameter space into evaluating one-dimensional prediction spaces. The method is also applicable if there are non-identifiable parameters yielding to some insufficiently specified model predictions that can be interpreted as non-observability. Moreover, a validation profile likelihood is introduced that should be applied when noisy validation experiments are to be interpreted. The properties and applicability of the prediction and validation profile likelihood approaches are demonstrated by two examples, a small and instructive ODE model describing two consecutive reactions, and a realistic ODE model for the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. The presented general approach constitutes a concept for observability analysis and for generating reliable confidence intervals of model predictions, not only, but especially suitable for mathematical models of biological systems.},

The quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (OMLE) converges to a well defined limit, and may or may not be consistent for particular parameters of interest. Standard tests (Wald, Lagrange Multiplier, or Likelihood Ratio) are invalid in the presence of misspecification, but more general statistics are given which allow inferences to be drawn robustly. The properties of the QMLE and the information matrix are exploited to yield several useful tests for model misspecification.},

    url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20758},
    abstract = {Modern observatories are designed to deliver increasingly detailed views of astrophysical signals. To fully realize the potential of these observations, principled data-analysis methods are required to effectively separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components from data corrupted by noise and instrumental effects. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-frequency Bayesian model of the sky emission field that leverages latent-space tension as an indicator of model misspecification, enabling automated separation of diffuse, point-like, and extended astrophysical emission components across wavelength bands. Deviations from latent-space prior expectations are used as diagnostics for model misspecification, thus systematically guiding the introduction of new sky components, such as point-like and extended sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic multi-frequency imaging data and apply it to observational X-ray data from the eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) of the SN1987A region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results highlight the method's capability to reconstruct astrophysical components with high accuracy, achieving sub-pixel localization of point sources, robust separation of extended emission, and detailed uncertainty quantification. The developed methodology offers a general and well-founded framework applicable to a wide variety of astronomical datasets, and is therefore well suited to support the analysis needs of next-generation multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.},

    title = {Evaluating statistical uncertainties and correlations using the bootstrap method},
    url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/2759945},
    abstract = {The bootstrap method is a powerful technique to evaluate the statistical uncertainty of a measurement and correlations between bins. This method uses a set of replicas of the nominal dataset, derived by introducing Poisson perturbations corresponding to statistical fluctuations. Each replica is then analyzed in the same way as the nominal dataset to arrive at a set of replica measurements. The statistical uncertainty and correlations can then be extracted from these replica measurements. This note describes a version of the bootstrap method suitable for data analysis in high energy physics and provides an associated software implementation. Various applications are discussed, such as determining the statistical error on systematic uncertainties. A novel feature of the provided software is that the fluctuations that generate the bootstrap replicas are deterministic. This makes it is possible to evaluate statistical correlations between measurements that are using fully or partially overlapping input data, even if the associated analyses are performed by different teams, or years apart.},

    abstract = {Researchers have increasingly realized the need to account for within-group dependence in estimating standard errors of regression parameter estimates. The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10\% using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5\% using our methods.},

    abstract = {We extend the jackknife and the bootstrap method of estimating standard errors to the case where the observations form a general stationary sequence. We do not attempt a reduction to i.i.d. values. The jackknife calculates the sample variance of replicates of the statistic obtained by omitting each block of \$l\$ consecutive data once. In the case of the arithmetic mean this is shown to be equivalent to a weighted covariance estimate of the spectral density of the observations at zero. Under appropriate conditions consistency is obtained if \$l = l(n) {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\$ and \$l(n)/n {\textbackslash}rightarrow 0\$. General statistics are approximated by an arithmetic mean. In regular cases this approximation determines the asymptotic behavior. Bootstrap replicates are constructed by selecting blocks of length \$l\$ randomly with replacement among the blocks of observations. The procedures are illustrated by using the sunspot numbers and some simulated data.},

    abstract = {Various bootstraps have been proposed for bootstrapping clustered data from one-way arrays. The simulation results in the literature suggest that some of these methods work quite well in practice; the theoretical results are limited and more mixed in their conclusions. For example, McCullagh reached negative conclusions about the use of non-parametric bootstraps for one-way arrays. The purpose of this paper is to extend our understanding of the issues by discussing the effect of different ways of modelling clustered data, the criteria for successful bootstraps used in the literature and extending the theory from functions of the sample mean to include functions of the between and within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps to include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the consistency of variance estimates for a bootstrap method depends on the choice of model with the residual bootstrap giving consistency under the transformation model whereas the cluster bootstrap gives consistent estimates under both the transformation and the random-effect model. In addition we note that the criteria based on the distribution of the bootstrap observations are not really useful in assessing consistency.},

We will also illustrate how bootstrap resampling can be used to diagnose this model class. In addition, lmeresampler makes it easy to construct interval estimates of functions of model parameters.},

    abstract = {Anisotropic flow and radial flow are two key probes of the expansion dynamics and properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). While anisotropic flow has been extensively studied, radial flow, which governs the system's radial expansion, has received less attention. Notably, experimental evidence for the global and collective nature of radial flow has been lacking. This Letter presents the first measurement of transverse momentum (\$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$) dependence of radial flow fluctuations (\$v\_0(p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\})\$) over \$0.5{\textless}p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}{\textless}10\$ GeV, using a two-particle correlation method in Pb+Pb collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{NN\}\}\}=5.02\$ TeV. The data reveal three key features supporting the collective nature of radial flow: long-range correlation in pseudorapidity, factorization in \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$, and centrality-independent shape in \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$. The comparison with a hydrodynamic model demonstrates the sensitivity of \$v\_0(p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\})\$ to bulk viscosity, a crucial transport property of the QGP. These findings establish a new, powerful tool for probing collective dynamics and properties of the QGP.},

It is shown that the CPD can be approximated by a scaled Poisson distribution (SPD). The SPD is applied to parameter estimation in situations where the data are distorted by resolution effects. It performs considerably better than the normal approximation that is usually used. A special Poisson bootstrap technique is presented which permits to derive confidence limits for observations following the CPD.},

    abstract = {We study the problem of data-driven background estimation, arising in the search of physics signals predicted by the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider. Our work is motivated by the search for the production of pairs of Higgs bosons decaying into four bottom quarks. A number of other physical processes, known as background, also share the same final state. The data arising in this problem is therefore a mixture of unlabeled background and signal events, and the primary aim of the analysis is to determine whether the proportion of unlabeled signal events is nonzero. A challenging but necessary first step is to estimate the distribution of background events. Past work in this area has determined regions of the space of collider events where signal is unlikely to appear, and where the background distribution is therefore identifiable. The background distribution can be estimated in these regions, and extrapolated into the region of primary interest using transfer learning with a multivariate classifier. We build upon this existing approach in two ways. First, we revisit this method by developing a customized residual neural network which is tailored to the structure and symmetries of collider data. Second, we develop a new method for background estimation, based on the optimal transport problem, which relies on modeling assumptions distinct from earlier work. These two methods can serve as cross-checks for each other in particle physics analyses, due to the complementarity of their underlying assumptions. We compare their performance on simulated double Higgs boson data.},

    abstract = {We give a self-contained (though sketchy) derivation of the charged multiplicity distribution of final hadrons in a simplified (only pions) version of the statistical bootstrap model (SBM). The analytical form of this distribution is determined by two prominent features of SBM: a singularity at some temperatureT 0 (related to the phase transition hadrons → quark-gluon plasma) and the production of Poisson-distributed hadron clusters with well-defined decay structure. The multiplicity distribution of final hadrons has two free parameters: an average temperatureT and the mean numberN¯ of clusters, both depending on the collision energy √s such that for √s→∞, the temperature tends to the limitT 0 whileN¯ may grow (very slowly) without bound. With these two free parameters we obtain reasonable to good fits to experimental data at energies ranging from √s=7.87 to 900 GeV (full and in some cases cut pseudorapidity). The average cluster sizes found in our fits are compatible with those inferred from (pseudo) rapidity correlations in the data. We discuss the relation of this model to the negative binomial distribution (NBD).},

The classical Neyman procedure for setting confidence bounds in this situation is arguably unsatisfactory and several alternatives have been recently proposed.

These include the likelihood principle, which has not hitherto been very widely accepted, in contrast with the conditionality concept which many statisticians are inclined to accept for purposes of “informative inference.” The likelihood principle states that the “evidential meaning” of experimental results is characterized fully by the likelihood function, without other reference to the structure of an experiment, in contrast with standard methods in which significance and confidence levels are based on the complete experimental model. The principal writers supporting the likelihood principle have been Fisher and G. A. Barnard, in addition to Bayesian writers for whom it represents the “directly empirical” part of their standpoint. The likelihood principle suggests certain systematic reinterpretations and revisions of standard methods, including “intrinsic significance and confidence levels” and “intrinsic standard errors,” which are developed and illustrated.

    abstract = {Suppose an observable x is the measured value (negative or non-negative) of a true mean mu (physically non-negative) in an experiment with a Gaussian resolution function with known fixed rms deviation s. The most powerful one-sided upper confidence limit at 95\% C.L. is UL = x+1.64s, which I refer to as the "original diagonal line". Perceived problems in HEP with small or non-physical upper limits for x{\textless}0 historically led, for example, to substitution of max(0,x) for x, and eventually to abandonment in the Particle Data Group's Review of Particle Physics of this diagonal line relationship between UL and x. Recently Cowan, Cranmer, Gross, and Vitells (CCGV) have advocated a concept of "power constraint" that when applied to this problem yields variants of diagonal line, including UL = max(-1,x)+1.64s. Thus it is timely to consider again what is problematic about the original diagonal line, and whether or not modifications cure these defects. In a 2002 Comment, statistician Leon Jay Gleser pointed to the literature on recognizable and relevant subsets. For upper limits given by the original diagonal line, the sample space for x has recognizable relevant subsets in which the quoted 95\% C.L. is known to be negatively biased (anti-conservative) by a finite amount for all values of mu. This issue is at the heart of a dispute between Jerzy Neyman and Sir Ronald Fisher over fifty years ago, the crux of which is the relevance of pre-data coverage probabilities when making post-data inferences. The literature describes illuminating connections to Bayesian statistics as well. Methods such as that advocated by CCGV have 100\% unconditional coverage for certain values of mu and hence formally evade the traditional criteria for negatively biased relevant subsets; I argue that concerns remain. Comparison with frequentist intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins also sheds light on the issues.},

    abstract = {Researchers often want to place a confidence interval around estimated parameter values calculated from a sample. This is commonly implemented by bootstrapping. There are several different frequently used bootstrapping methods for this purpose. Here we demonstrate that authors of recent papers frequently do not specify the method they have used and that different methods can produce markedly different confidence intervals for the same sample and parameter estimate. We encourage authors to be more explicit about the method they use (and number of bootstrap resamples used). We recommend the bias corrected and accelerated method as giving generally good performance; although researchers should be warned that coverage of bootstrap confidence intervals is characteristically less than the specified nominal level, and confidence interval evaluation by any method can be unreliable for small samples in some situations.},
