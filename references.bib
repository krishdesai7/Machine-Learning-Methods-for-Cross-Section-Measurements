  abstract = {Scientific machine learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems and PDE discovery in computational physics. One caveat concerning current methods is the need for large amounts of ("clean") data, in order to characterize the full system response and discover underlying physical models. Bayesian methods may be particularly promising for overcoming these challenges, as they are naturally less sensitive to the negative effects of sparse and noisy data. In this paper, we propose to use Bayesian neural networks (BNN) in order to: 1) Recover the full system states from measurement data (e.g. temperature, velocity field, etc.). We use Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo to sample the posterior distribution of a deep and dense BNN, and show that it is possible to accurately capture physics of varying complexity, without overfitting. 2) Recover the parameters instantiating the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) governing the physical system. Using the trained BNN, as a surrogate of the system response, we generate datasets of derivatives that are potentially comprising the latent PDE governing the observed system and then perform a sequential threshold Bayesian linear regression (STBLR), between the successive derivatives in space and time, to recover the original PDE parameters. We take advantage of the confidence intervals within the BNN outputs, and introduce the spatial derivatives cumulative variance into the STBLR likelihood, to mitigate the influence of highly uncertain derivative data points; thus allowing for more accurate parameter discovery. We demonstrate our approach on a handful of example, in applied physics and non-linear dynamics.},

  abstract = {Measurements of jet substructure are key to probing the energy frontier at colliders, and many of them use track-based observables which take advantage of the angular precision of tracking detectors. Theoretical calculations of track-based observables require `track functions', which characterize the transverse momentum fraction \$r\_q\$ carried by charged hadrons from a fragmenting quark or gluon. This letter presents a direct measurement of \$r\_q\$ distributions in dijet events from the 140 fb\$\textasciicircum\{-1\}\$ of proton--proton collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\}=13\$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. The data are corrected for detector effects using machine-learning methods. The scale evolution of the moments of the \$r\_q\$ distribution is sensitive to non-linear renormalization group evolution equations of QCD, and is compared with analytic predictions. When incorporated into future theoretical calculations, these results will enable a precision program of theory-data comparison for track-based jet substructure observables.},

This allows us to successfully identify informative points for active learning of functions with heteroscedastic and bimodal noise.

  abstract = {Spectral Graph Neural Network is a kind of Graph Neural Network (GNN) based on graph signal filters. Some models able to learn arbitrary spectral filters have emerged recently. However, few works analyze the expressive power of spectral GNNs. This paper studies spectral GNNs’ expressive power theoretically. We first prove that even spectral GNNs without nonlinearity can produce arbitrary graph signals and give two conditions for reaching universality. They are: 1) no multiple eigenvalues of graph Laplacian, and 2) no missing frequency components in node features. We also establish a connection between the expressive power of spectral GNNs and Graph Isomorphism (GI) testing, the latter of which is often used to characterize spatial GNNs’ expressive power. Moreover, we study the difference in empirical performance among different spectral GNNs with the same expressive power from an optimization perspective, and motivate the use of an orthogonal basis whose weight function corresponds to the graph signal density in the spectrum. Inspired by the analysis, we propose JacobiConv, which uses Jacobi basis due to its orthogonality and flexibility to adapt to a wide range of weight functions. JacobiConv deserts nonlinearity while outperforming all baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

The repriorisation map acts directly on parameters, and its analytic simplicity complements the known neural network Gaussian process (NNGP) behaviour of wide BNNs in function space. Exploiting the repriorisation, we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior sampling algorithm which mixes faster the wider the BNN. This contrasts with the typically poor performance of MCMC in high dimensions. We observe up to 50x higher effective sample size relative to no reparametrisation for both fully-connected and residual networks. Improvements are achieved at all widths, with the margin between reparametrised and standard BNNs growing with layer width.},

For computational reasons, researchers approximate this posterior using inexpensive mini-batch methods such as mean-field variational inference or stochastic-gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC). To investigate foundational questions in Bayesian deep learning, we instead use full-batch Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) on modern architectures. We show that (1) BNNs can achieve significant performance gains over standard training and deep ensembles; (2) a single long HMC chain can provide a comparable representation of the posterior to multiple shorter chains; (3) in contrast to recent studies, we find posterior tempering is not needed for near-optimal performance, with little evidence for a "cold posterior" effect, which we show is largely an artifact of data augmentation; (4) BMA performance is robust to the choice of prior scale, and relatively similar for diagonal Gaussian, mixture of Gaussian, and logistic priors; (5) Bayesian neural networks show surprisingly poor generalization under domain shift; (6) while cheaper alternatives such as deep ensembles and SGMCMC methods can provide good generalization, they provide distinct predictive distributions from HMC. Notably, deep ensemble predictive distributions are similarly close to HMC as standard SGLD, and closer than standard variational inference.},

On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model -- uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.},

They introduce and review fundamental theorems and principles of machine learning within the context of collider particle physics, focused on application to jet identification and discrimination. Numerous examples of binary discrimination in jet physics are studied in detail, including \$H\textbackslash to b\textbackslash bar b\$ identification in fixed-order perturbation theory, generic one-versus two-prong discrimination with parametric power counting techniques, and up versus down quark jet classification by assuming the central limit theorem, isospin conservation, and a convergent moment expansion of the single particle energy distribution. Quark versus gluon jet discrimination is considered in multiple contexts, from using additive, infrared and collinear safe observables, to using hadronic multiplicity, and to including measurements of the jet charge. While many of the results presented here are well known, some novel results are presented, the most prominent being a parametrized expression for the likelihood ratio of quark versus gluon discrimination for jets on which hadronic multiplicity and jet charge are simultaneously measured. End-of-lecture exercises are also provided.},

  abstract = {Differentiable simulators continue to push the state of the art across a range of domains including computational physics, robotics, and machine learning. Their main value is the ability to compute gradients of physical processes, which allows differentiable simulators to be readily integrated into commonly employed gradient-based optimization schemes. To achieve this, a number of design decisions need to be considered representing trade-offs in versatility, computational speed, and accuracy of the gradients obtained. This paper presents an in-depth review of the evolving landscape of differentiable physics simulators. We introduce the foundations and core components of differentiable simulators alongside common design choices. This is followed by a practical guide and overview of open-source differentiable simulators that have been used across past research. Finally, we review and contextualize prominent applications of differentiable simulation. By offering a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in differentiable simulation, this work aims to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners looking to understand and integrate differentiable physics within their research. We conclude by highlighting current limitations as well as providing insights into future directions for the field.},

However, despite this algorithmic progress and the promise of improved uncertainty quantification and sample efficiency there are---as of early 2020---no publicized deployments of Bayesian neural networks in industrial practice. In this work we cast doubt on the current understanding of Bayes posteriors in popular deep neural networks: we demonstrate through careful MCMC sampling that the posterior predictive induced by the Bayes posterior yields systematically worse predictions compared to simpler methods including point estimates obtained from SGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predictive performance is improved significantly through the use of a "cold posterior" that overcounts evidence. Such cold posteriors sharply deviate from the Bayesian paradigm but are commonly used as heuristic in Bayesian deep learning papers. We put forward several hypotheses that could explain cold posteriors and evaluate the hypotheses through experiments. Our work questions the goal of accurate posterior approximations in Bayesian deep learning: If the true Bayes posterior is poor, what is the use of more accurate approximations? Instead, we argue that it is timely to focus on understanding the origin of the improved performance of cold posteriors.},

	title        = {Search for Higgs boson production in association with top quarks and decaying into bottom quarks using deep learning techniques with the CMS experiment},
	DOI          = {10.18154/rwth-2019-06415},
	abstractNote = {After the discovery of the Higgs boson during the first run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), precise measurements of its properties and couplings to other particles are conducted by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Due to its high mass, the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) predicts that the top quark, among all fermions, exhibits the strongest coupling to the Higgs boson with a Yukawa coupling constant close to unity. Therefore, the accurate measurement of Higgs-top coupling is essential for probing predictions of the SM and to constrain theories that reach beyond it. This thesis presents a search for the associated production of a Higgs boson with a top quark pair at a center-of-mass energy of s = 13 TeV. The data from proton-proton collisions of the second run of the LHC was recorded by the CMS detector in 2016 and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The analysis focuses on events where the Higgs boson decays into a pair of bottom quarks and the decay of the tt\textasciimacron{} system involves one or two electrons or muons with opposite charge. In addition to the lepton requirements, events are selected to have missing transverse energy and at least four energetic jets of, which at least three must have a b tag. The analysis is dominated by systematic uncertainties in the normalization of tt\textasciimacron{} background contributions with additional heavy-flavor jets, especially from tt\textasciimacron{}+bb\textasciimacron{}, tt\textasciimacron{}+bb\textasciimacron{}, tt\textasciimacron{}+2b, and tt\textasciimacron{}+cc\textasciimacron{} production. To reduce their impact on the analysis, a novel event categorization scheme based on deep neural networks is introduced. In contrast to binary classification, the networks perform a multi-class classification, which attributes events with a probability to originate from either the signal process or a particular background process. The information of the highest probability is exploited to create mutually exclusive categories that are enriched with events of one of the considered physics processes. As the tt\textasciimacron{} +heavy-flavor normalization uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated in the signal extraction procedure, the simultaneous isolation of backgrounds using this approach leads to more accurate background constraints and, in turn, to a gain in signal sensitivity. Results are obtained in a simultaneous measurement over 24 orthogonal categories defined by the lepton channel, the number of jets, and the most probable process as attributed by the deep neural networks. In each category, the distribution of the network output unit that corresponds to the assigned process category is fitted to data. The best fit value of the tt\textasciimacron{}H signal strength modifier \ensuremath{\mu} = \ensuremath{\sigma}/\ensuremath{\sigma}SM is extracted in a profile likelihood fit with systematic uncertainties incorporated as nuisance parameters. Upper limits on \ensuremath{\mu} are computed using the asymptotic CLS method at 95\% confidence level. The SM predicts a tt\textasciimacron{}H production cross section of \ensuremath{\sigma}SM = 507-50+35 fb with NLO QCD accuracy and NLO electroweak corrections. This analysis measures an observed upper limit on the tt\textasciimacron{}H signal strength modifier of \ensuremath{\mu}obs< 1.85, which excludes greater values with 95\% confidence given the measured data. The background-only hypothesis is disfavored due to an expected limit of \ensuremath{\mu}exp< 0.99-0.29+0.42 in case of a signal strength as predicted by the SM. The observed best fit value is measured as \ensuremath{\mu}obs = 0.98-0.48+0.50 = 0.98-0.25+0.26 (stat.)-0.41+0.43 (syst.). A value of \ensuremath{\mu}exp = 1.00-0.49+0.55 is expected from simulation. The corresponding observed (expected) significance amounts to 2.04 (1.92) standard deviations above the expected background. The total uncertainty predominantly originates from systematic effects. The analysis in the semi-lepton channel as presented in this thesis contributed to the first observations of both tt\textasciimacron{}H production and Higgs bosons decaying into bottom quarks, performed with the CMS experiment.},

Using data from previous editions, plus 2,873 new measurements from 758 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 118 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Neutrinos in Cosmology. Starting with this edition, the Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and all review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings. Review articles that were previously part of the Listings are now included in volume 1. The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (http://pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is also available.

Several novel automatic optimisation techniques are employed on the computation graphs that significantly increase performance compared to conventional approaches. MoreFit can make efficient use of a wide range of heterogeneous platforms through its compute backends that rely on open standards. It provides an OpenCL backend for execution on GPUs of all major vendors, and a backend based on LLVM and Clang for single- or multithreaded execution on CPUs, which in addition allows for SIMD vectorisation. MoreFit is benchmarked against several other fitting frameworks and shows very promising performance, illustrating the power of the approach.},

While a variety of powerful methods are available if the dimensionality of the feature space is small, such tests rapidly lose power as the dimensionality increases and the data inevitably become sparse. Machine learning classifiers are powerful tools capable of reducing highly multivariate problems into univariate ones, on which commonly used tests such as \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ or Kolmogorov-Smirnov may be applied. We explore applying both traditional and machine-learning-based tests to several example problems, and study how the power of each approach depends on the dimensionality. A pedagogical discussion is provided on which types of problems are best suited to using traditional versus machine-learning-based tests, and on the how to properly employ the machine-learning-based approach.},

Our primary focus is constraining the Wilson coefficients in the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT), but the methodology applies to broader parametric models of phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). We elevate the well-established procedures for binned Poisson counting experiments to the unbinned case by utilizing machine-learned surrogates of the likelihood ratio. This approach can be applied to various theoretical, modeling, and experimental uncertainties. By establishing a common statistical framework for BSM and systematic effects, we lay the groundwork for future unbinned analyses at the LHC. Additionally, we introduce a novel tree-boosting algorithm capable of learning highly accurate parameterizations of systematic effects. This algorithm extends the existing toolkit with a versatile and robust alternative. We demonstrate our approach using the example of an SMEFT interpretation of highly energetic top quark pair production in proton-proton collisions.},

We then review new simulation-based inference methods that let us directly analyze high-dimensional data by combining machine learning techniques and information from the simulator. Initial studies indicate that these techniques have the potential to substantially improve the precision of LHC measurements. Finally, we discuss probabilistic programming, an emerging paradigm that lets us extend inference to the latent process of the simulator.},

We apply these techniques to a specific class of statistical model that can incorporate uncertainties in parameters that themselves represent uncertainties (informally, "errors on errors") called the Gamma Variance Model. This model contains fixed parameters, generically called \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$, that represent the relative uncertainties in estimates of standard deviations of Gaussian distributed measurements. If the \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ parameters are small, one can construct confidence intervals and \$p\$-values using standard asymptotic methods. This is formally similar to the familiar situation of a large data sample, in which estimators for all adjustable parameters have Gaussian distributions. Here we address the important case where the \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ parameters are not small and as a consequence the asymptotic distributions do not represent a good approximation. We investigate improved test statistics based on the technology of higher-order asymptotics (\$p{\textasciicircum}*\$ approximation and Bartlett correction).},

The key feature of these techniques is blinking, alternation of bright and dark states, of each emitter so that no more than one emitter is bright within the width of the point-spread function of the microscope during a time sufficient for its localization. We give a formulation of the optical part of these techniques in terms of quantum metrology, where the limit of precision is determined by the Fisher information on the emitters positions contained in the measurement data. We show that the advantage in resolution provided by making the emitters blink is a consequence of the fundamental property of Fisher information, its convexity. In particular, we prove the weak matrix convexity and the trace convexity of the Fisher information matrix -- two fundamental results in the multiparameter estimation theory. We show also that the advantage in information is inherent to the quantum state of light itself before the measurement and is related to the convexity of the quantum Fisher information matrix.},

Based on the original proposal by D'Agnolo and Wulzer (arXiv:1806.02350), the model evaluates the compatibility between experimental data and a reference model, by implementing a hypothesis testing procedure based on the likelihood ratio. Model-independence is enforced by avoiding any prior assumption about the presence or shape of new physics components in the measurements. We show that our approach has dramatic advantages compared to neural network implementations in terms of training times and computational resources, while maintaining comparable performances.

    abstract = {The effect of event background fluctuations on charged particle jet reconstruction in Pb-Pb collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm NN\}\} = 2.76\$ TeV has been measured with the ALICE experiment. The main sources of non-statistical fluctuations are characterized based purely on experimental data with an unbiased method, as well as by using single high \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ particles and simulated jets embedded into real Pb-Pb events and reconstructed with the anti-\$k\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ jet finder. The influence of a low transverse momentum cut-off on particles used in the jet reconstruction is quantified by varying the minimum track \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ between 0.15 GeV/\$c\$ and 2 GeV/\$c\$. For embedded jets reconstructed from charged particles with \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\} {\textgreater} 0.15\$ GeV/\$c\$, the uncertainty in the reconstructed jet transverse momentum due to the heavy-ion background is measured to be 11.3 GeV/\$c\$ (standard deviation) for the 10\% most central Pb-Pb collisions, slightly larger than the value of 11.0 GeV/\$c\$ measured using the unbiased method. For a higher particle transverse momentum threshold of 2 GeV/\$c\$, which will generate a stronger bias towards hard fragmentation in the jet finding process, the standard deviation of the fluctuations in the reconstructed jet transverse momentum is reduced to 4.8-5.0 GeV/\$c\$ for the 10\% most central events. A non-Gaussian tail of the momentum uncertainty is observed and its impact on the reconstructed jet spectrum is evaluated for varying particle momentum thresholds, by folding the measured fluctuations with steeply falling spectra.},

    abstract = {Improved jet energy scale corrections, based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse-femtobarns collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, are presented. The corrections as a function of pseudorapidity eta and transverse momentum pT are extracted from data and simulated events combining several channels and methods. They account successively for the effects of pileup, uniformity of the detector response, and residual data-simulation jet energy scale differences. Further corrections, depending on the jet flavor and distance parameter (jet size) R, are also presented. The jet energy resolution is measured in data and simulated events and is studied as a function of pileup, jet size, and jet flavor. Typical jet energy resolutions at the central rapidities are 15-20\% at 30 GeV, about 10\% at 100 GeV, and 5\% at 1 TeV. The studies exploit events with dijet topology, as well as photon+jet, Z+jet and multijet events. Several new techniques are used to account for the various sources of jet energy scale corrections, and a full set of uncertainties, and their correlations, are provided. The final uncertainties on the jet energy scale are below 3\% across the phase space considered by most analyses (pT {\textgreater} 30 GeV and abs(eta) {\textless} 5.0). In the barrel region (abs(eta) {\textless} 1.3) an uncertainty below 1\% for pT {\textgreater} 30 GeV is reached, when excluding the jet flavor uncertainties, which are provided separately for different jet flavors. A new benchmark for jet energy scale determination at hadron colliders is achieved with 0.32\% uncertainty for jets with pT of the order of 165-330 GeV, and abs(eta) {\textless} 0.8.},

During Run 2 (years 2015-2018) the LHC eventually reached a luminosity of 2.1 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{34\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, almost three times that reached during Run 1 (2009-2013) and a factor of two larger than the LHC design value, leading to events with up to a mean of about 50 simultaneous inelastic proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing (pileup). The CMS Level-1 trigger was upgraded prior to 2016 to improve the selection of physics events in the challenging conditions posed by the second run of the LHC. This paper describes the performance of the CMS Level-1 trigger upgrade during the data taking period of 2016-2018. The upgraded trigger implements pattern recognition and boosted decision tree regression techniques for muon reconstruction, includes pileup subtraction for jets and energy sums, and incorporates pileup-dependent isolation requirements for electrons and tau leptons. In addition, the new trigger calculates high-level quantities such as the invariant mass of pairs of reconstructed particles. The upgrade reduces the trigger rate from background processes and improves the trigger efficiency for a wide variety of physics signals.},

Radiation hardness and excellent physics performance will be achieved by utilising silicon pad sensors and SiPM-on-scintillator tiles with high longitudinal and transverse segmentation. One of the major challenges of the HL-LHC will be the high pileup environment, with interaction vertices spread not only in position, but also in time. In order to efficiently reject particles originating from pileup, precision timing information of the order of 30 ps will be of great benefit. In order to meet such performance goals, the HGCAL will provide timing measurements for individual hits with signals above 12 fC (equivalent to 3-10 MIPs), such that clusters resulting from particles with \$p\_T\$ {\textgreater} 5 GeV should have a timing resolution better than 30 ps. Given the complexity and size of the system, this poses a particular challenge to the readout electronics as well as to the calibration and reconstruction procedures. We present the challenges for the front-end electronics design, results from prototype tests in laboratory and beam environments, as well as anticipated timing performance from simulation.},

In a realistic detector simulation, our method outperforms classical benchmark algorithms for pile-up mitigation in key observables.

The model is of particular use in analyses that combine the results of several measurements. In the past, combinations have been carried out using two alternative approaches: the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) method or what we will call the nuisance-parameter method. In this paper we derive useful relations that allow one to connect the BLUE and nuisance-parameter methods when the correlations induced by systematic uncertainties are non-trivial (1, -1 or 0), and we generalise the nuisance-parameter approach to include errors-on-errors. We then illustrate some of the properties of the GVM by applying it to the 7-8 TeV ATLAS-CMS top quark mass combination. We present results by considering the largest systematic uncertainties as uncertain, one at a time, and we vary their associated error-on-error parameters. This procedure is useful for identifying the systematic uncertainties to which a combination is sensitive when they are themselves uncertain. We also explore the hypothetical scenario of including an outlier in the combination, which could become relevant for future combinations, by artificially adding a fictitious measurement to it. This example highlights a key feature of the GVM: its sensitivity to the internal consistency of the input data.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance/ these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a 'generative model' for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are 'nuisance parameters' to marginalize away.},

    abstract = {The advent of large data-set in cosmology has meant that in the past 10 or 20 years our knowledge and understanding of the Universe has changed not only quantitatively but also, and most importantly, qualitatively. Cosmologists rely on data where a host of useful information is enclosed, but is encoded in a non-trivial way. The challenges in extracting this information must be overcome to make the most of a large experimental effort. Even after having converged to a standard cosmological model (the LCDM model) we should keep in mind that this model is described by 10 or more physical parameters and if we want to study deviations from it, the number of parameters is even larger. Dealing with such a high dimensional parameter space and finding parameters constraints is a challenge on itself. Cosmologists want to be able to compare and combine different data sets both for testing for possible disagreements (which could indicate new physics) and for improving parameter determinations. Finally, cosmologists in many cases want to find out, before actually doing the experiment, how much one would be able to learn from it. For all these reasons, sophisiticated statistical techniques are being employed in cosmology, and it has become crucial to know some statistical background to understand recent literature in the field. I will introduce some statistical tools that any cosmologist should know about in order to be able to understand recently published results from the analysis of cosmological data sets. I will not present a complete and rigorous introduction to statistics as there are several good books which are reported in the references. The reader should refer to those.},

The modified Friedmann equations yield the Hubble parameter as \$ H(z) = H\_0 {\textbackslash}sqrt\{(1 - λ) + λ(1 + z){\textasciicircum}\{3(1 + w)\}\},\$ with the parameters {\textbackslash}( λ= {\textbackslash}fracγ\{6αH\_0{\textasciicircum}2\} + 1 {\textbackslash}) and {\textbackslash}( w = {\textbackslash}frac\{β(n - 2) + 1\}\{2β- 1\} {\textbackslash}). Using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we constrain the model parameters with recent observational data, including cosmic chronometers, the Pantheon+ Supernovae dataset, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters. The best-fit values are found to be {\textbackslash}( H\_0 = 72.773{\textasciicircum}\{+0.148\}\_\{-0.152\} {\textbackslash}) km/s/Mpc, {\textbackslash}( λ= 0.289{\textasciicircum}\{+0.007\}\_\{-0.007\} {\textbackslash}), and {\textbackslash}( w = -0.002{\textasciicircum}\{+0.002\}\_\{-0.002\} {\textbackslash}), all quoted at the 1{\textbackslash}(σ{\textbackslash}) confidence level.This model predicts a transition redshift of {\textbackslash}( z\_t {\textbackslash}approx 0.76 {\textbackslash}) for the onset of cosmic acceleration and an estimated universe age of 13.21 Gyr. The higher inferred value of {\textbackslash}( H\_0 {\textbackslash}) compared to the Planck 2018 result offers a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Additionally, using {\textbackslash}( ρ\_0 = 0.534 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-30\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}text\{g/cm\}{\textasciicircum}3 {\textbackslash}) and assuming {\textbackslash}( n = 1 {\textbackslash}), we derive the model constants as {\textbackslash}( β= 1.00201 {\textbackslash}), {\textbackslash}( α= 512247 {\textbackslash}), and {\textbackslash}( γ= -1.215 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-29\} {\textbackslash}). We also evaluate the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to compare the model's performance with that of the standard {\textbackslash}(Λ{\textbackslash})CDM model. The small BIC difference ({\textbackslash}( Δ{\textbackslash}text\{BIC\} = 0.16 {\textbackslash})) indicates comparable statistical support for both models. Thus, the {\textbackslash}( f(R, L\_m) {\textbackslash}) gravity scenario serves as a consistent and viable alternative to {\textbackslash}(Λ{\textbackslash})CDM, potentially addressing open questions in late-time cosmology.},

We use the profile-likelihood ratio for statistical inference and focus on the case in which the model is determined from Monte Carlo simulated samples of finite size. We start by presenting a toy model in which the asymptotic properties of the profile-likelihood ratio are manifestly broken even if the numbers of events per bin in both the data and simulated samples are seemingly large enough to warrant their validity. We then move to the general setting to show how statistical uncertainties in the Monte Carlo predictions can affect the coverage of confidence intervals constructed in the asymptotic approximation always in the same direction, namely they lead to systematic under-coverage.},

When observations are correlated or clustered, results obtained from the standard software require adjustment. This tutorial compares two approaches, using examples that illustrate various designs for both independent and clustered data. One approach obtains initial estimates using software that assume independence among observations, then adjusts these estimates using a design effect (DE), also called a variance inflation factor (VIF). A second approach generates estimates using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) that account directly for patterns of clustering and correlation. The two approaches generally produce similar estimates and so validate one another. For certain clustered designs, small differences in power estimates emphasize the importance of specifying an alternative hypothesis in terms of means but also in terms of expected variances and covariances. Both approaches to power estimation are sensitive to assumptions concerning the structure or pattern of independence or correlation among clustered outcomes.},

    abstract = {In this article, we develop methods for sample size and power calculations in four-level intervention studies when intervention assignment is carried out at any level, with a particular focus on cluster randomized trials (CRTs). CRTs involving four levels are becoming popular in health care research, where the effects are measured, for example, from evaluations (level 1) within participants (level 2) in divisions (level 3) that are nested in clusters (level 4). In such multi-level CRTs, we consider three types of intraclass correlations between different evaluations to account for such clustering: that of the same participant, that of different participants from the same division, and that of different participants from different divisions in the same cluster. Assuming arbitrary link and variance functions, with the proposed correlation structure as the true correlation structure, closed-form sample size formulas for randomization carried out at any level (including individually randomized trials within a four-level clustered structure) are derived based on the generalized estimating equations approach using the model-based variance and using the sandwich variance with an independence working correlation matrix. We demonstrate that empirical power corresponds well with that predicted by the proposed method for as few as 8 clusters, when data are analyzed using the matrix-adjusted estimating equations for the correlation parameters with a bias-corrected sandwich variance estimator, under both balanced and unbalanced designs.},

    abstract = {Cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) are a well-established class of designs for evaluating large-scale, community-based research questions. An essential task in planning these trials is determining the required number of clusters and cluster sizes to achieve sufficient statistical power for detecting a clinically relevant effect size. Compared to methods for evaluating the average treatment effect (ATE) for the entire study population, there is more recent development of sample size methods for testing the heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTEs), i.e., modification of treatment effects by subpopulation characteristics, in CRTs. For confirmatory analyses of HTEs in CRTs, effect modifiers must be pre-specified, and ideally, accompanied by sample size or power calculations to ensure the trial has adequate power for the planned analyses. Power analysis for HTE analyses is more complex than for ATEs due to the additional design parameters that must be specified. Power and sample size formulas for HTE analyses have been separately derived under several cluster-randomized designs, including single and multi-period parallel designs, crossover designs, and stepped-wedge designs, as well as under continuous and binary outcomes. This tutorial provides a consolidated reference guide for these methods and enhances their accessibility through the development of an online R Shiny calculator. We further discuss key considerations for researchers conducting sample size and power calculations for testing pre-specified HTE hypotheses in CRTs, including the essential role of advance estimates of intracluster correlation coefficients for both outcomes and covariates on power. The sample size methodology and calculator functionality are demonstrated through real CRT examples.},

Using the UCI Combined Cycle Power Plant Dataset, we establishthe superiority of IG-based models over traditional approaches through rigorous statistical testing and model validation.

To correct for this, an asymptotically efficient, rescaled partial trace estimator is proposed. Motivated by this rescaling, we introduce an orthogonal parameterization for the set of Kronecker covariances. High-dimensional consistency results using the partial trace estimator are obtained that demonstrate a blessing of dimensionality. In settings where an array has at least order three, it is shown that as the array dimensions jointly increase, it is possible to consistently estimate the Kronecker covariance matrix, even when the sample size is one.},

To address this, we propose an adjustment that mitigates this inflation by employing full-rank covariance matrices. Through simulations, we validate the effectiveness of this adjustment in controlling false sign rates, thereby improving the robustness of empirical Bayes methods in high-dimensional settings. Our results show that the rank of the prior covariance matrix directly influences the accuracy of sign estimation and the performance of the lfsr, with significant implications for large-scale hypothesis testing in statistics and genomics.},

    abstract = {Composite likelihood provides approximate inference when the full likelihood is intractable and sub-likelihood functions of marginal events can be evaluated relatively easily. It has been successfully applied for many complex models. However, its wider application is limited by two issues. First, weight selection of marginal likelihood can have a significant impact on the information efficiency and is currently an open question. Second, calibrated Bayesian inference with composite likelihood requires curvature adjustment which is difficult for dependent data. This work shows that approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) can properly address these two issues by using multiple composite score functions as summary statistics. First, the summary-based posterior distribution gives the optimal Godambe information among a wide class of estimators defined by linear combinations of estimating functions. Second, to make ABC computationally feasible for models where marginal likelihoods have no closed form, a novel approach is proposed to estimate all simulated marginal scores using a Monte Carlo sample with size N. Sufficient conditions are given for the additional noise to be negligible with N fixed as the data size n goes to infinity, and the computational cost is O(n). Third, asymptotic properties of ABC with summary statistics having heterogeneous convergence rates is derived, and an adaptive scheme to choose the component composite scores is proposed. Numerical studies show that the new method significantly outperforms the existing Bayesian composite likelihood methods, and the efficiency of adaptively combined composite scores well approximates the efficiency of particle MCMC using the full likelihood.},

    abstract = {Elo rating, widely used for skill assessment across diverse domains ranging from competitive games to large language models, is often understood as an incremental update algorithm for estimating a stationary Bradley-Terry (BT) model. However, our empirical analysis of practical matching datasets reveals two surprising findings: (1) Most games deviate significantly from the assumptions of the BT model and stationarity, raising questions on the reliability of Elo. (2) Despite these deviations, Elo frequently outperforms more complex rating systems, such as mElo and pairwise models, which are specifically designed to account for non-BT components in the data, particularly in terms of win rate prediction. This paper explains this unexpected phenomenon through three key perspectives: (a) We reinterpret Elo as an instance of online gradient descent, which provides no-regret guarantees even in misspecified and non-stationary settings. (b) Through extensive synthetic experiments on data generated from transitive but non-BT models, such as strongly or weakly stochastic transitive models, we show that the ''sparsity'' of practical matching data is a critical factor behind Elo's superior performance in prediction compared to more complex rating systems. (c) We observe a strong correlation between Elo's predictive accuracy and its ranking performance, further supporting its effectiveness in ranking.},

In the present paper the structure of small sample tests, whether these are related to problems of estimation and fiducial distributions, or are of the nature of tests of goodness of fit, is considered further. The notation a {\textbar} b implies as before that the variate a is conditioned by a given value of b. The fixed variate b may be denoted by {\textbar} b, and analogously if b is clear from the context, a {\textbar} b may be written simply as a {\textbar}. Corresponding to the idea of ancillary information introduced by Fisher for the case of a single unknown θ, where auxiliary statistics control the accuracy of our estimate, I have termed a conditional statistic of the form T {\textbar}, quasi-sufficient, if its distribution satisfies the “sufficiency” property and contains all the information on θ. In the more general case of other unknowns, such a statistic may contain all the available information on θ.},

    abstract = {Consider a binary mixture model of the form \$F\_{\textbackslash}theta = (1-{\textbackslash}theta)F\_0 + {\textbackslash}theta F\_1\$, where \$F\_0\$ is standard Gaussian and \$F\_1\$ is a completely specified heavy-tailed distribution with the same support. For a sample of \$n\$ independent and identically distributed values \$X\_i {\textbackslash}sim F\_{\textbackslash}theta\$, the maximum likelihood estimator \${\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\_n\$ is asymptotically normal provided that \$0 {\textless} {\textbackslash}theta {\textless} 1\$ is an interior point. This paper investigates the large-sample behaviour for boundary points, which is entirely different and strikingly asymmetric for \${\textbackslash}theta=0\$ and \${\textbackslash}theta=1\$. The reason for the asymmetry has to do with typical choices such that \$F\_0\$ is an extreme boundary point and \$F\_1\$ is usually not extreme. On the right boundary, well known results on boundary parameter problems are recovered, giving \${\textbackslash}lim {\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_1({\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\_n {\textless} 1)=1/2\$. On the left boundary, \${\textbackslash}lim{\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_0({\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\_n {\textgreater} 0)=1-1/{\textbackslash}alpha\$, where \$1{\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}leq 2\$ indexes the domain of attraction of the density ratio \$f\_1(X)/f\_0(X)\$ when \$X{\textbackslash}sim F\_0\$. For \${\textbackslash}alpha=1\$, which is the most important case in practice, we show how the tail behaviour of \$F\_1\$ governs the rate at which \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_0({\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\_n {\textgreater} 0)\$ tends to zero. A new limit theorem for the joint distribution of the sample maximum and sample mean conditional on positivity establishes multiple inferential anomalies. Most notably, given \${\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\_n {\textgreater} 0\$, the likelihood ratio statistic has a conditional null limit distribution \$G{\textbackslash}neq{\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\_1\$ determined by the joint limit theorem. We show through this route that no advantage is gained by extending the single distribution \$F\_1\$ to the nonparametric composite mixture generated by the same tail-equivalence class.},

This is usually achieved through twin studies by assessing the collective genetic impact defined by the differential correlation in monozygotic twins vs dizygotic twins. Since the underlying order in a twin, determined by latent genetic factors, is unknown, the observed twin data are unordered. Conventional methods for correlation are not appropriate. To handle the missing order, we model twin data by a mixture bivariate distribution and estimate under two likelihood functions: the likelihood over the monozygotic and dizygotic twins separately, and the likelihood over the two twin types combined. Both likelihood estimators are consistent. More importantly, the combined likelihood overcomes the drawback of mixture distribution estimation, namely, the slow convergence. It yields correlation coefficient estimator of root-n consistency and allows effective statistical inference on the collective genetic impact. The method is demonstrated by a twin study on immune traits.},

    abstract = {A confidence distribution is a complete tool for making frequentist inference for a parameter of interest \${\textbackslash}psi\$ based on an assumed parametric model. Indeed, it allows to reach point estimates, to assess their precision, to set up tests along with measures of evidence for statements of the type "\${\textbackslash}psi {\textgreater} {\textbackslash}psi\_0\$" or "\${\textbackslash}psi\_1 {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}psi {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}psi\_2\$", to derive confidence intervals, comparing the parameter of interest with other parameters from other studies, etc. The aim of this contribution is to discuss robust confidence distributions derived from unbiased \$M-\$estimating functions, which provide robust inference for \${\textbackslash}psi\$ when the assumed distribution is just an approximate parametric model or in the presence of deviant values in the observed data. Paralleling likelihood-based results and extending results available for robust scoring rules, we first illustrate how robust confidence distributions can be derived from the asymptotic theory of robust pivotal quantities. Then, we discuss the derivation of robust confidence distributions via simulation methods. An application and a simulation study are illustrated in the context of non-inferiority testing, in which null hypotheses of the form \$H\_0: {\textbackslash}psi {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}psi\_0\$ are of interest.},

    abstract = {Continuous response variables often need to be transformed to meet regression modeling assumptions; however, finding the optimal transformation is challenging and results may vary with the choice of transformation. When a continuous response variable is measured repeatedly for a subject or the continuous responses arise from clusters, it is more challenging to model the continuous response data due to correlation within clusters. We extend a widely used ordinal regression model, the cumulative probability model (CPM), to fit clustered continuous response variables based on generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods for ordinal responses. With our approach, estimates of marginal parameters, cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), expectations, and quantiles conditional on covariates can be obtained without pre-transformation of the potentially skewed continuous response data. Computational challenges arise with large numbers of distinct values of the continuous response variable, and we propose two feasible and computationally efficient approaches to fit CPMs for clustered continuous response variables with different working correlation structures. We study finite sample operating characteristics of the estimators via simulation, and illustrate their implementation with two data examples. One studies predictors of CD4:CD8 ratios in an HIV study. The other uses data from The Lung Health Study to investigate the contribution of a single nucleotide polymorphism to lung function decline.},

    abstract = {While widely used as a general method for uncertainty quantification, the bootstrap method encounters difficulties that raise concerns about its validity in practical applications. This paper introduces a new resampling-based method, termed \${\textbackslash}textit\{calibrated bootstrap\}\$, designed to generate finite sample-valid parametric inference from a sample of size \$n\$. The central idea is to calibrate an \$m\$-out-of-\$n\$ resampling scheme, where the calibration parameter \$m\$ is determined against inferential pivotal quantities derived from the cumulative distribution functions of loss functions in parameter estimation. The method comprises two algorithms. The first, named \${\textbackslash}textit\{resampling approximation\}\$ (RA), employs a \${\textbackslash}textit\{stochastic approximation\}\$ algorithm to find the value of the calibration parameter \$m=m\_{\textbackslash}alpha\$ for a given \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ in a manner that ensures the resulting \$m\$-out-of-\$n\$ bootstrapped \$1-{\textbackslash}alpha\$ confidence set is valid. The second algorithm, termed \${\textbackslash}textit\{distributional resampling\}\$ (DR), is developed to further select samples of bootstrapped estimates from the RA step when constructing \$1-{\textbackslash}alpha\$ confidence sets for a range of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ values is of interest. The proposed method is illustrated and compared to existing methods using linear regression with and without \$L\_1\$ penalty, within the context of a high-dimensional setting and a real-world data application. The paper concludes with remarks on a few open problems worthy of consideration.},

    abstract = {Mechanistic dynamic models of biochemical networks such as Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) contain unknown parameters like the reaction rate constants and the initial concentrations of the compounds. The large number of parameters as well as their nonlinear impact on the model responses hamper the determination of confidence regions for parameter estimates. At the same time, classical approaches translating the uncertainty of the parameters into confidence intervals for model predictions are hardly feasible. In this article it is shown that a so-called prediction profile likelihood yields reliable confidence intervals for model predictions, despite arbitrarily complex and high-dimensional shapes of the confidence regions for the estimated parameters. Prediction confidence intervals of the dynamic states allow a data-based observability analysis. The approach renders the issue of sampling a high-dimensional parameter space into evaluating one-dimensional prediction spaces. The method is also applicable if there are non-identifiable parameters yielding to some insufficiently specified model predictions that can be interpreted as non-observability. Moreover, a validation profile likelihood is introduced that should be applied when noisy validation experiments are to be interpreted. The properties and applicability of the prediction and validation profile likelihood approaches are demonstrated by two examples, a small and instructive ODE model describing two consecutive reactions, and a realistic ODE model for the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. The presented general approach constitutes a concept for observability analysis and for generating reliable confidence intervals of model predictions, not only, but especially suitable for mathematical models of biological systems.},

    abstract = {Modern observatories are designed to deliver increasingly detailed views of astrophysical signals. To fully realize the potential of these observations, principled data-analysis methods are required to effectively separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components from data corrupted by noise and instrumental effects. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-frequency Bayesian model of the sky emission field that leverages latent-space tension as an indicator of model misspecification, enabling automated separation of diffuse, point-like, and extended astrophysical emission components across wavelength bands. Deviations from latent-space prior expectations are used as diagnostics for model misspecification, thus systematically guiding the introduction of new sky components, such as point-like and extended sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic multi-frequency imaging data and apply it to observational X-ray data from the eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) of the SN1987A region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results highlight the method's capability to reconstruct astrophysical components with high accuracy, achieving sub-pixel localization of point sources, robust separation of extended emission, and detailed uncertainty quantification. The developed methodology offers a general and well-founded framework applicable to a wide variety of astronomical datasets, and is therefore well suited to support the analysis needs of next-generation multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.},

    abstract = {The bootstrap method is a powerful technique to evaluate the statistical uncertainty of a measurement and correlations between bins. This method uses a set of replicas of the nominal dataset, derived by introducing Poisson perturbations corresponding to statistical fluctuations. Each replica is then analyzed in the same way as the nominal dataset to arrive at a set of replica measurements. The statistical uncertainty and correlations can then be extracted from these replica measurements. This note describes a version of the bootstrap method suitable for data analysis in high energy physics and provides an associated software implementation. Various applications are discussed, such as determining the statistical error on systematic uncertainties. A novel feature of the provided software is that the fluctuations that generate the bootstrap replicas are deterministic. This makes it is possible to evaluate statistical correlations between measurements that are using fully or partially overlapping input data, even if the associated analyses are performed by different teams, or years apart.},

Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10\% using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5\% using our methods.},

Under appropriate conditions consistency is obtained if \$l = l(n) {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\$ and \$l(n)/n {\textbackslash}rightarrow 0\$. General statistics are approximated by an arithmetic mean. In regular cases this approximation determines the asymptotic behavior.

The simulation results in the literature suggest that some of these methods work quite well in practice; the theoretical results are limited and more mixed in their conclusions. For example, McCullagh reached negative conclusions about the use of non-parametric bootstraps for one-way arrays. The purpose of this paper is to extend our understanding of the issues by discussing the effect of different ways of modelling clustered data, the criteria for successful bootstraps used in the literature and extending the theory from functions of the sample mean to include functions of the between and within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps to include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the consistency of variance estimates for a bootstrap method depends on the choice of model with the residual bootstrap giving consistency under the transformation model whereas the cluster bootstrap gives consistent estimates under both the transformation and the random-effect model. In addition we note that the criteria based on the distribution of the bootstrap observations are not really useful in assessing consistency.},

While anisotropic flow has been extensively studied, radial flow, which governs the system's radial expansion, has received less attention. Notably, experimental evidence for the global and collective nature of radial flow has been lacking. This Letter presents the first measurement of transverse momentum (\$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$) dependence of radial flow fluctuations (\$v\_0(p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\})\$) over \$0.5{\textless}p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}{\textless}10\$ GeV, using a two-particle correlation method in Pb+Pb collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{NN\}\}\}=5.02\$ TeV. The data reveal three key features supporting the collective nature of radial flow: long-range correlation in pseudorapidity, factorization in \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$, and centrality-independent shape in \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$. The comparison with a hydrodynamic model demonstrates the sensitivity of \$v\_0(p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\})\$ to bulk viscosity, a crucial transport property of the QGP. These findings establish a new, powerful tool for probing collective dynamics and properties of the QGP.},

    abstract = {We study the problem of data-driven background estimation, arising in the search of physics signals predicted by the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider. Our work is motivated by the search for the production of pairs of Higgs bosons decaying into four bottom quarks. A number of other physical processes, known as background, also share the same final state. The data arising in this problem is therefore a mixture of unlabeled background and signal events, and the primary aim of the analysis is to determine whether the proportion of unlabeled signal events is nonzero. A challenging but necessary first step is to estimate the distribution of background events. Past work in this area has determined regions of the space of collider events where signal is unlikely to appear, and where the background distribution is therefore identifiable. The background distribution can be estimated in these regions, and extrapolated into the region of primary interest using transfer learning with a multivariate classifier. We build upon this existing approach in two ways. First, we revisit this method by developing a customized residual neural network which is tailored to the structure and symmetries of collider data. Second, we develop a new method for background estimation, based on the optimal transport problem, which relies on modeling assumptions distinct from earlier work. These two methods can serve as cross-checks for each other in particle physics analyses, due to the complementarity of their underlying assumptions. We compare their performance on simulated double Higgs boson data.},

    abstract = {We give a self-contained (though sketchy) derivation of the charged multiplicity distribution of final hadrons in a simplified (only pions) version of the statistical bootstrap model (SBM). The analytical form of this distribution is determined by two prominent features of SBM: a singularity at some temperatureT 0 (related to the phase transition hadrons → quark-gluon plasma) and the production of Poisson-distributed hadron clusters with well-defined decay structure. The multiplicity distribution of final hadrons has two free parameters: an average temperatureT and the mean numberN¯ of clusters, both depending on the collision energy √s such that for √s→∞, the temperature tends to the limitT 0 whileN¯ may grow (very slowly) without bound. With these two free parameters we obtain reasonable to good fits to experimental data at energies ranging from √s=7.87 to 900 GeV (full and in some cases cut pseudorapidity). The average cluster sizes found in our fits are compatible with those inferred from (pseudo) rapidity correlations in the data. We discuss the relation of this model to the negative binomial distribution (NBD).},

These are examples of experiments which offer the possibility of yielding a result, recognized a priori to be relatively improbable, of a negative estimate for a quantity known to be positive. The classical Neyman procedure for setting confidence bounds in this situation is arguably unsatisfactory and several alternatives have been recently proposed. We compare methods for setting Gaussian and Poisson confidence intervals for cases in which the parameter to be estimated is bounded. These procedures lead to substantially different intervals when a relatively improbable observation implies a parameter estimate beyond the bound.},

W. Tukey, and others. This concept is formulated as a principle of conditionality, from which some general consequences are deduced mathematically. These include the likelihood principle, which has not hitherto been very widely accepted, in contrast with the conditionality concept which many statisticians are inclined to accept for purposes of “informative inference.” The likelihood principle states that the “evidential meaning” of experimental results is characterized fully by the likelihood function, without other reference to the structure of an experiment, in contrast with standard methods in which significance and confidence levels are based on the complete experimental model. The principal writers supporting the likelihood principle have been Fisher and G. A. Barnard, in addition to Bayesian writers for whom it represents the “directly empirical” part of their standpoint. The likelihood principle suggests certain systematic reinterpretations and revisions of standard methods, including “intrinsic significance and confidence levels” and “intrinsic standard errors,” which are developed and illustrated. The close relations between non-Bayesian likelihood methods and Bayesian methods are discussed.},

The most powerful one-sided upper confidence limit at 95\% C.L. is UL = x+1.64s, which I refer to as the "original diagonal line". Perceived problems in HEP with small or non-physical upper limits for x{\textless}0 historically led, for example, to substitution of max(0,x) for x, and eventually to abandonment in the Particle Data Group's Review of Particle Physics of this diagonal line relationship between UL and x. Recently Cowan, Cranmer, Gross, and Vitells (CCGV) have advocated a concept of "power constraint" that when applied to this problem yields variants of diagonal line, including UL = max(-1,x)+1.64s. Thus it is timely to consider again what is problematic about the original diagonal line, and whether or not modifications cure these defects. In a 2002 Comment, statistician Leon Jay Gleser pointed to the literature on recognizable and relevant subsets. For upper limits given by the original diagonal line, the sample space for x has recognizable relevant subsets in which the quoted 95\% C.L. is known to be negatively biased (anti-conservative) by a finite amount for all values of mu. This issue is at the heart of a dispute between Jerzy Neyman and Sir Ronald Fisher over fifty years ago, the crux of which is the relevance of pre-data coverage probabilities when making post-data inferences. The literature describes illuminating connections to Bayesian statistics as well. Methods such as that advocated by CCGV have 100\% unconditional coverage for certain values of mu and hence formally evade the traditional criteria for negatively biased relevant subsets; I argue that concerns remain. Comparison with frequentist intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins also sheds light on the issues.},

We encourage authors to be more explicit about the method they use (and number of bootstrap resamples used). We recommend the bias corrected and accelerated method as giving generally good performance; although researchers should be warned that coverage of bootstrap confidence intervals is characteristically less than the specified nominal level, and confidence interval evaluation by any method can be unreliable for small samples in some situations.},

However, several recent breakthroughs in transfer learning suggest that these networks can cope with severe distribution shifts and successfully adapt to new tasks from a few training examples. In this work we study the interplay between out-of-distribution and transfer performance of modern image classification CNNs for the first time and investigate the impact of the pre-training data size, the model scale, and the data preprocessing pipeline. We find that increasing both the training set and model sizes significantly improve the distributional shift robustness. Furthermore, we show that, perhaps surprisingly, simple changes in the preprocessing such as modifying the image resolution can significantly mitigate robustness issues in some cases. Finally, we outline the shortcomings of existing robustness evaluation datasets and introduce a synthetic dataset SI-Score we use for a systematic analysis across factors of variation common in visual data such as object size and position.},

    abstract = {In this article, we introduce a novel normalization technique for neural network weight matrices, which we term weight conditioning. This approach aims to narrow the gap between the smallest and largest singular values of the weight matrices, resulting in better-conditioned matrices. The inspiration for this technique partially derives from numerical linear algebra, where well-conditioned matrices are known to facilitate stronger convergence results for iterative solvers. We provide a theoretical foundation demonstrating that our normalization technique smoothens the loss landscape, thereby enhancing convergence of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. Empirically, we validate our normalization across various neural network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and 3D shape modeling. Our findings indicate that our normalization method is not only competitive but also outperforms existing weight normalization techniques from the literature.},

Traditional unfolding techniques have been employed to correct for these distortions, yet they often suffer from model dependency and stability issues. We present a novel method, SwdFold, which utilizes the principles of optimal transport to provide a robust, model-independent framework to estimate the probability density ratio for data unfolding. It not only unfold the toy experimental event by reweighted simulated data distributions closely with true distributions but also maintains the integrity of physical features across various observables. We can expect it can enable more reliable predictions and comprehensive analyses as a high precision reweighting and unfolding tool in high-energy physics.},

In any case, it is crucial for young researchers to stay on top of this development and apply cutting-edge methods and tools to all LHC physics tasks. These lecture notes lead students with basic knowledge of particle physics and significant enthusiasm for machine learning to relevant applications. They start with an LHC-specific motivation and a non-standard introduction to neural networks and then cover classification, unsupervised classification, generative networks, data representations, and inverse problems. Three themes defining much of the discussion are statistically defined loss functions, uncertainties, and accuracy. To understand the applications, the notes include some aspects of theoretical LHC physics. All examples are chosen from particle physics publications of the last few years, and many of them come with corresponding tutorials.},

As a result, these events are often used to probe the nature of the strong force, improve Monte Carlo event generators, and search for deviations from Standard Model predictions. All previous measurements of \$Z\$ boson production characterize the event properties using a small number of observables and present the results as differential cross sections in predetermined bins. In this analysis, a machine learning method called OmniFold is used to produce a simultaneous measurement of twenty-four \$Z\$+jets observables using \$139\$ fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ of proton-proton collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=13\$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector. Unlike any previous fiducial differential cross-section measurement, this result is presented unbinned as a dataset of particle-level events, allowing for flexible re-use in a variety of contexts and for new observables to be constructed from the twenty-four measured observables.},

    abstract = {Measurements of jet substructure are key to probing the energy frontier at colliders, and many of them use track-based observables which take advantage of the angular precision of tracking detectors. Theoretical calculations of track-based observables require `track functions', which characterize the transverse momentum fraction \$r\_q\$ carried by charged hadrons from a fragmenting quark or gluon. This letter presents a direct measurement of \$r\_q\$ distributions in dijet events from the 140 fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ of proton--proton collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=13\$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. The data are corrected for detector effects using machine-learning methods. The scale evolution of the moments of the \$r\_q\$ distribution is sensitive to non-linear renormalization group evolution equations of QCD, and is compared with analytic predictions. When incorporated into future theoretical calculations, these results will enable a precision program of theory-data comparison for track-based jet substructure observables.},

    abstract = {Parameter estimation via unbinned maximum likelihood fits is central for many analyses performed in high energy physics. Unbinned maximum likelihood fits using event weights, for example to statistically subtract background contributions via the sPlot formalism, or to correct for acceptance effects, have recently seen increasing use in the community. However, it is well known that the naive approach to the estimation of parameter uncertainties via the second derivative of the logarithmic likelihood does not yield confidence intervals with the correct coverage in the presence of event weights. This paper derives the asymptotically correct expressions and compares them with several commonly used approaches for the determination of parameter uncertainties, some of which are shown to not generally be asymptotically correct. In addition, the effect of uncertainties on event weights is discussed, including uncertainties that can arise from the presence of nuisance parameters in the determination of sWeights.},

Under moderate conditions on the population covariance/precision matrix itself and on the penalty function, we prove some consistency results for our estimators. A blockwise coordinate descent algorithm, which iteratively updates L and D, is then proposed to obtain the estimator in practice. Finally, various numerical experiments are presented: using simulated data, we show that our estimator performs quite well in terms of the Kullback-Leibler loss; using stock return data, we show that our method can be applied to obtain enhanced solutions to the Markowitz portfolio selection problem.},

We experimentally compare our method to an existing method known as LieGAN and show that our method is competitive at detecting affine symmetries for large sample sizes and superior than LieGAN for small sample sizes.

In this paper we consider the unsupervised and semi-supervised problems of learning such symmetries in a distribution directly from data in a model-free fashion. We show that in the worst case this problem is as difficult as the graph automorphism problem. However, if we restrict to the case where the covariance matrix has unique eigenvalues, then the eigenvectors will also be eigenvectors of the symmetry transformation. If we further restrict to finding orthogonal symmetries, then the eigenvalues will be either be 1 or -1, and the problem reduces to determining which eigenvectors are which. We develop and compare theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of different methods of selecting which eigenvectors should have eigenvalue -1 in the symmetry transformation, and discuss how to extend this approach to non-orthogonal cases where we have labels},

We initiate the study of full-range EEC at hadron colliders, generalizing the extensively studied EEC in \$e{\textasciicircum}+e{\textasciicircum}-\$ collision as well as the transverse EEC in hadron collisions. We derive celestial blocks from Lorentz symmetry to perform partial wave decomposition of the EEC at hadron colliders. These celestial blocks are essentially conformal blocks on the 2d celestial sphere, which have additional dependence on the collinear spin of ``light-ray transition matrix'' along the collision axis. In this work, we perform the first leading-order (LO) analytic calculation of this observable in pure Yang-Mills theory and use it as an example to illustrate the block decomposition. Numerically, the block expansion demonstrates superior accuracy in the collinear limit compared to conventional power series expansion. Analytically, we observe in this example that the block coefficients exhibit analyticity in both collinear and transverse spin. In addition, we analyze several kinematic limits at LO -- collinear, back-to-back, opposite coplanar and Regge limit. While the first three limits naturally generalize their \$e{\textasciicircum}+e{\textasciicircum}-\$ collision counterparts or transverse EEC and are governed by soft-collinear dynamics, the Regge limit requires complete angular dependence and reveals BFKL physics. Phenomenologically, we propose a realistic experimental setup and briefly discuss how the convolution of parton distribution function modifies the perturbative EEC result. Our work suggests that the full-range EEC at hadron colliders is an elegant observable which probes a broader kinematic space and connects various regimes of different QCD dynamics through a single measurement.},

We carefully compare double parton scattering to relevant background processes and trace a path towards a clean signal sample. Several observables are constructed to demonstrate the effect of parton correlations with respect to clear benchmark values for uncorrelated scatterings. We find that especially spin correlations can be responsible for large effects in the variables we study, because of their direct relation with the parton angular momentum and, therefore, the directions of the muon momenta. We estimate the significance of the measurements as a function of the integrated luminosity and conclude that the LHC has the potential to detect, or put strong limits on, parton correlations in the near future.},

    abstract = {We present a neural network architecture that is fully equivariant with respect to transformations under the Lorentz group, a fundamental symmetry of space and time in physics. The architecture is based on the theory of the finite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group and the equivariant nonlinearity involves the tensor product. For classification tasks in particle physics, we demonstrate that such an equivariant architecture leads to drastically simpler models that have relatively few learnable parameters and are much more physically interpretable than leading approaches that use CNNs and point cloud approaches. The competitive performance of the network is demonstrated on a public classification dataset [27] for tagging top quark decays given energy-momenta of jet constituents produced in proton-proton collisions.},

    abstract = {The gravitational couplings of matter are studied in the presence of Lorentz and CPT violation. At leading order in the coefficients for Lorentz violation, the relativistic quantum hamiltonian is derived from th
e gravitationally coupled minimal Standard-Model Extension. For spin-independent effects, the nonrelativistic quantum hamiltonian and the classical dynamics for test and source bodies are obtained. A systematic perturbative method is
developed to treat small metric and coefficient fluctuations about a Lorentz-violating and Minkowski background. The post-newtonian metric and the trajectory of a test body freely falling under gravity in the presence of Lorentz viola

including gravimeter measurements, laboratory and satellite tests of the weak equivalence principle, antimatter studies, solar-system observations, and investigations of the gravitational properties of light. Numerous sensitivities to
 coefficients for Lorentz violation can be achieved in existing or near-future experiments at the level of parts in 10{\textasciicircum}3 down to parts in 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}. Certain coefficients are uniquely detectable in gravitational searches and remain unmea

After a brief historical outline, the book begins with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow. Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence. The classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics are presented in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. It contains much original material, and is peppered with examples and insights drawn from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle research.

    abstract = {Recognizing symmetries in data allows for significant boosts in neural network training, which is especially important where training data are limited. In many cases, however, the exact underlying symmetry is present only in an idealized dataset, and is broken in actual data, due to asymmetries in the detector, or varying response resolution as a function of particle momentum. Standard approaches, such as data augmentation or equivariant networks fail to represent the nature of the full, broken symmetry, effectively overconstraining the response of the neural network. We propose a learning model which balances the generality and asymptotic performance of unconstrained networks with the rapid learning of constrained networks. This is achieved through a dual-subnet structure, where one network is constrained by the symmetry and the other is not, along with a learned symmetry factor. In a simplified toy example that demonstrates violation of Lorentz invariance, our model learns as rapidly as symmetry-constrained networks but escapes its performance limitations.},

There are also a number of finite symmetry groups that are related to the finite number of distinct elementary particle types. I offer a group-theorist's perspective on these groups, and suggest some ways in which a deeper use of group theory might in principle be useful.

ESM achieves this by optimizing a loss function that balances equivariance preservation with the penalization of redundant solutions, ensuring the complete and accurate identification of all symmetry transformations. We apply this framework specifically to dynamical systems, identifying their symmetry groups directly from observed trajectory data. To demonstrate its versatility, we test ESM on multiple systems in two distinct scenarios: (i) when the governing equations are known theoretically and (ii) when they are unknown, and the equivariance finding relies solely on observed data. The latter case highlights ESM’s fully data-driven capability, as it requires no prior knowledge of the system’s equations to operate.},

    abstract = {Noether’s calculus of invariant variations yields exact identities from functional symmetries. The standard application to an action integral allows to identify conservation laws. Here we rather consider generating functionals, such as the free energy and the power functional, for equilibrium and driven many-body systems. Translational and rotational symmetry operations yield mechanical laws. These global identities express vanishing of total internal and total external forces and torques. We show that functional differentiation then leads to hierarchies of local sum rules that interrelate density correlators as well as static and time direct correlation functions, including memory. For anisotropic particles, orbital and spin motion become systematically coupled. The theory allows us to shed new light on the spatio-temporal coupling of correlations in complex systems. As applications we consider active Brownian particles, where the theory clarifies the role of interfacial forces in motility-induced phase separation. For active sedimentation, the center-of-mass motion is constrained by an internal Noether sum rule.},

    abstract = {In practice, encoding invariances into models improves sample complexity. In this work, we study this phenomenon from a theoretical perspective. In particular, we provide minimax optimal rates for kernel ridge regression on compact manifolds, with a target function that is invariant to a group action on the manifold. Our results hold for any smooth compact Lie group action, even groups of positive dimension. For a finite group, the gain effectively multiplies the number of samples by the group size. For groups of positive dimension, the gain is observed by a reduction in the manifold's dimension, in addition to a factor proportional to the volume of the quotient space. Our proof takes the viewpoint of differential geometry, in contrast to the more common strategy of using invariant polynomials. This new geometric viewpoint on learning with invariances may be of independent interest.},

    abstract = {Euclidean deep learning is often inadequate for addressing real-world signals where the representation space is irregular and curved with complex topologies. Interpreting the geometric properties of such feature spaces has become paramount in obtaining robust and compact feature representations that remain unaffected by nontrivial geometric transformations, which vanilla CNNs cannot effectively handle. Recognizing rotation, translation, permutation, or scale symmetries can lead to equivariance properties in the learned representations. This has led to notable advancements in computer vision and machine learning tasks under the framework of geometric deep learning, as compared to their invariant counterparts. In this report, we emphasize the importance of symmetry group equivariant deep learning models and their realization of convolution-like operations on graphs, 3D shapes, and non-Euclidean spaces by leveraging group theory and symmetry. We categorize them as regular, steerable, and PDE-based convolutions and thoroughly examine the inherent symmetries of their input spaces and ensuing representations. We also outline the mathematical link between group convolutions or message aggregation operations and the concept of equivariance. The report also highlights various datasets, their application scopes, limitations, and insightful observations on future directions to serve as a valuable reference and stimulate further research in this emerging discipline.},

While existing methods for hard-coding transformations in neural networks require prior knowledge of the symmetries of the task at hand, this work focuses on discovering and characterizing unknown symmetries present in the dataset, namely, Lie group symmetry transformations beyond the traditional ones usually considered in the field (rotation, scaling, and translation). Specifically, we consider a scenario in which a dataset has been transformed by a one-parameter subgroup of transformations with different parameter values for each data point. Our goal is to characterize the transformation group and the distribution of the parameter values. The results showcase the effectiveness of the approach in both these settings.},

Automatic symmetry discovery methods aim to relax this constraint and learn invariance and equivariance from data. However, existing symmetry discovery methods are limited to simple linear symmetries and cannot handle the complexity of real-world data. We propose a novel generative model, Latent LieGAN (LaLiGAN), which can discover symmetries of nonlinear group actions. It learns a mapping from the data space to a latent space where the symmetries become linear and simultaneously discovers symmetries in the latent space. Theoretically, we show that our model can express nonlinear symmetries under some conditions about the group action. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately discover the intrinsic symmetry in high-dimensional dynamical systems. LaLiGAN also results in a well-structured latent space that is useful for downstream tasks including equation discovery and long-term forecasting.},

    url = {https://zenodo.org/records/4536377},
    abstract = {This is the first R\&D dataset for the LHC Olympics 2020 Anomaly Detection Challenge. It consists of 1M QCD dijet events and 100k W'-{\textgreater}XY events, with X-{\textgreater}qq and Y-{\textgreater}qq. The W', X, and Y masses are 3.5 TeV, 500 GeV and 100 GeV respectively. The events are produced using Pythia8 and Delphes 3.4.1, with no pileup or MPI included. They are selected using a single fat-jet (R=1) trigger with pT threshold of 1.2 TeV. 
The events are randomly shuffled together, but for the purposes of testing and development, we provide the user with a signal/background truth bit for each event. Obviously, the truth bit will not be included in the actual challenge.
These events are stored as pandas dataframes saved to compressed h5 format. For each event, all Delphes reconstructed particles in the event are assumed to be massless and are recorded in detector coordinates (pT, eta, phi). More detailed information such as particle charge is not included. Events are zero padded to constant size arrays of 700 particles, with the truth bit appended at the end. The array format is therefore (Nevents=1.1M, 2101).
For more information, including an example Jupyter notebook illustrating how to read and process the events, see the official LHC Olympics 2020 webpage.

UPDATE May 18 2020
We have uploaded a second signal dataset for R\&D, consisting of 100k W'-{\textgreater}XY with X,Y-{\textgreater}qqq (i.e. 3-prong substructure). Everything else about this signal dataset (particle masses, trigger, Pythia configuration, detector simulation) is the same as the previous one described above. 
UPDATE November 23 2020
We now include high-level feature files for the background and 2-prong signal (events\_anomalydetection\_v2.features.h5) and for the 3-prong signal (events\_anomalydetection\_Z\_XY\_qqq.features.h5). To produce the features, we have clustered every event into R=1 jets using the anti-kT algorithm. The features (calculated using fastjet plugins) are the 3-momenta, invariant masses, and n-jettiness variables tau1, tau2 and tau3 for the highest pT jet (j1) and the second highest pT jet (j2):
'pxj1', 'pyj1', 'pzj1', 'mj1', 'tau1j1', 'tau2j1', 'tau3j1', 'pxj2', 'pyj2', 'pzj2', 'mj2', 'tau1j2', 'tau2j2', 'tau3j2'
The rows (events) in each feature file should be ordered exactly the same as in their corresponding raw event file. For convenience, we have also included the label (1 for signal and 0 for background) as an additional column in the first feature file (events\_anomalydetection\_v2.features.h5).
UPDATE February 11 2021
We have included the Delphes detector card and the Pythia8 command files used to produce the R\&D datasets.},

In contrast to traditional approach of operating on fixed dimensional vectors, we consider objective functions defined on sets that are invariant to permutations. Such problems are widespread, ranging from estimation of population statistics, to anomaly detection in piezometer data of embankment dams, to cosmology. Our main theorem characterizes the permutation invariant functions and provides a family of functions to which any permutation invariant objective function must belong. This family of functions has a special structure which enables us to design a deep network architecture that can operate on sets and which can be deployed on a variety of scenarios including both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks. We also derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for permutation equivariance in deep models. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on population statistic estimation, point cloud classification, set expansion, and outlier detection.},

Examples include clustering, learning vertex and edge features on graphs, and learning features on triplets in a collection. A natural approach for building Set2Graph models is to characterize all linear equivariant set-to-hypergraph layers and stack them with non-linear activations. This poses two challenges: (i) the expressive power of these networks is not well understood; and (ii) these models would suffer from high, often intractable computational and memory complexity, as their dimension grows exponentially. This paper advocates a family of neural network models for learning Set2Graph functions that is both practical and of maximal expressive power (universal), that is, can approximate arbitrary continuous Set2Graph functions over compact sets. Testing these models on different machine learning tasks, mainly an application to particle physics, we find them favorable to existing baselines.},

Many of them rely on a non-parametric nearest neighbors approach which suffers from the curse of dimensionality. We attempt to address that challenge by proposing a novel approach to the problem: Local Intrinsic Dimension estimation using approximate Likelihood (LIDL). Our method relies on an arbitrary density estimation method as its subroutine and hence tries to sidestep the dimensionality challenge by making use of the recent progress in parametric neural methods for likelihood estimation. We carefully investigate the empirical properties of the proposed method, compare them with our theoretical predictions, and show that LIDL yields competitive results on the standard benchmarks for this problem and that it scales to thousands of dimensions. What is more, we anticipate this approach to improve further with the continuing advances in the density estimation literature.},

Due to the presence of an emergent symmetry, i.e., a symmetry of the ground state that is absent in the underlying Hamiltonian, a three-dimensional interacting Bose system undergoes a chemical potential tuned quantum phase transition that is strictly two-dimensional.

The generalisation has been made in two directions: 1. the results obtained for one parameter are extended to an arbitrary number of parameters by the introduction of the ellipsoid-indicatrix of a probability law. The ellipsoids relating to an estimate of the parameters are outside a fixed ellipsoid. 2. these results are not only valid, when the observations are independent, but also when their probability law is arbitrary. b) At the end of the paper some theorems are developed in regard to the intimate relations between these questions and the probability laws that permit af an "exhaustive summary" (i.e. a generalised notion of "sufficient statistic", defined by the writer). He points out that if an exhaustive summary exists, it is possible, without any loss of precision, to restrict oneself to functions of the observations that only make use of this summary. When there is no exhaustive summary there would always be loss of precision, if the number of variables were reduced. These last-mentioned results are valid in the case of independent observations only.},

We then examine its use for boosted electroweak boson tagging at high momenta. It provides good performance when used as an input to machine learning. Much of this performance can be reproduced also within a transparent log-likelihood method, whose underlying assumption is that different regions of the primary Lund plane are largely decorrelated.

    abstract = {Higher order harmonic flow \$v\_n\$ (with \$n{\textbackslash}ge4\$) in heavy-ion collisions can be measured either with respect to their own plane, or with respect to a plane constructed using lower-order harmonics. By assuming that higher flow harmonics are the superposition of medium nonlinear and linear responses to initial anisotropies, we propose a set of nonlinear response coefficients \${\textbackslash}chi\_n\$'s, which are independent of initial state by construction. In experiments, \${\textbackslash}chi\_n\$'s can be extracted as the ratio between higher order harmonic flow measured in the plane constructed by \$v\_2\$ and \$v\_3\$, and moments of lower order harmonic flow. Simulations with single-shot hydrodynamics and AMPT model lead to results of these nonlinear response coefficients in good agreement with the experimental data at the LHC energy. Predictions for \$v\_7\$ and \$v\_8\$ measured with respect to plane of lower order harmonics are given accordingly.},

    abstract = {The automatic fine-tuning of isospin breaking effects by conformal coalescence found by Georgi in the 2-flavor Schwinger model is studied. The analytical results obtained for the bosonic correlators are elaborated and the mass splitting parameter in leading order determined. Numerical investigation of meson mass splitting confirms the exponential suppression of symmetry breaking effects even for mass differences \${\textbackslash}delta m\$ near the fermion mass \$m\_f\$.},
