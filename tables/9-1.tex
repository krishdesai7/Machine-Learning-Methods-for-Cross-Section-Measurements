    \caption[Comparative analysis of unfolding and symmetry discovery methods in particle physics.]{Comparison of unfolding and symmetry discovery approaches in high-energy physics data analysis. While unfolding aims to correct detector effects to recover true physical distributions, symmetry discovery seeks to identify invariance properties directly from data. These complementary techniques can be combined synergistically: unfolding provides cleaner distributions where symmetries become more apparent, while discovered symmetries can constrain and regularise the unfolding process. This bidirectional relationship enables more robust extraction of physical information from experimental data, particularly in scenarios where detector effects might obscure underlying symmetries or where symmetry constraints can help resolve unfolding ambiguities.}
