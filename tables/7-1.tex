        \toprule
        \textbf{Source} & \textbf{Impact on unfolded distributions} \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{Detector resolution} & 
        Finite resolution causes true events to migrate between measurement bins, inducing statistical correlations in the unfolded spectrum. 
        This migration induced covariance must be properly modelled to avoid biasing shape sensitive fits and to correctly propagate uncertainties through the unfolding procedure. \\
        
        \textbf{Pileup effects} & 
        Additional particles from simultaneous interactions contaminate all events within a luminosity block. 
        Residual uncertainties after pileup subtraction create correlated systematic effects across events and bins, affecting both normalisation and shape measurements. 
        The correlation strength typically scales with instantaneous luminosity and is therefore expected to be increasingly challenging to address in future high luminosity experiments. \\
        
        \textbf{Unfolding and regularisation} & 
        Smoothness constraints or penalty terms couple adjacent bin estimates or event weights, transforming independent Poisson counts into correlated random variables. 
        The resulting off--diagonal covariance terms can be non-trivial, particularly for aggressive regularisation schemes. 
        This coupling must be propagated to downstream analyses. \\
        
        \textbf{Systematic Uncertainties} & 
        Experimental systematics (luminosity calibration, trigger efficiency, energy scale) and theoretical uncertainties (PDF sets, scale variations) affect multiple bins coherently. 
        These produce positive correlations that, if neglected, lead to underestimated uncertainties on integrated quantities and incorrect confidence intervals for extracted parameters. \\
