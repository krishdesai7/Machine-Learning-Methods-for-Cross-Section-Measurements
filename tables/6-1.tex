    Reporting only low--order moments loses most distribution information.
    %
    Binned differential cross sections retain shape information but suffer from discretization and limited dimensionality.
    %
    Full spectral measurements preserve the complete distribution, enabling maximal reusability and detailed theory comparisons, but require regularizing a much more ill--posed training.
